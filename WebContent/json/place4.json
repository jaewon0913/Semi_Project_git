   "info": "The  Silsangsa Temple was constructed by monk Jeunggak, as one of nine special temples in the year 828. The temple was established because of the theory of divination, based on topology. The belief held that Korea’s good spirit would be taken away to Japan, bringing bad luck if the temple was not constructed on this particular location. The temple was reconstructed in the 26th year of Joseon Sukjong’s reign (1700) after it was completely destroyed by the Japanese invasion in 1597. However, it was almost burnt down in the 19th year of King Gojong’s reign (1882).<br> <br>It is presently preserved just as it belonged to the Unified Silla Kingdom, with its three-story pagoda and its 11 treasures with a total of 17 cultural assets. The entrance of the temple lies in the middle of a rice field and the temple has a pastoral view, surrounded by trees. From the entrance, you can cross the half-moon shaped stone bridge, and just beyond that a remarkable totem pole.",

In the early Joseon Period the mountain was named ‘Sokgeumsan,’ but began to be called ‘Maisan’ after the 12th year of King Taejong, who commented that the two peaks resembled a horse’s ears (‘maisan’ meaning ‘horse ears’). All along Maisan Mountain, you will find small crater-like rock cavities that are formed by prolonged weathering. These unique geological features, called ‘tafoni,’ are of great academic value. <br><br>\n\nInside Hwaeomgul Cave, you’ll find medicinal water that flows up from underground all throughout the year.

The temple was destroyed at one point in time, but Master Monk Jinul prayed that it be rebuilt. In accordance with his fervent hopes, in the 1600s the monk’s followers rebuilt a number of the temple’s halls and buildings, many of which can still be seen today. The temple is also remembered as the temple that King Injo helped rebuild with the hope that his two sons, who had been taken hostage by the Qing Dynasty during the Byeongjahoran War (Chinese invasion of Korea in 1636), would be returned safely and that Buddha would heal the nation.<br><br> \n\nOne of the Korea’s four major temples, Songgwangsa is home to Jijangbosal and Siwangsang statues (found in Jijangjeon Hall), a Seokgayeorae statue, and 500 Nahansang statues (found in Nahanjeon Hall). The temple is also home to eight Tangible Cultural Assets and four Treasured Cultural Assets: Daeungjeon Hall, the Samsebulsang statues, the bell-tower, and the Sacheonwangsang statue.\n<br><br>\nBeloved for its historical significance as well as its beauty, the temple draws throngs of worshipers throughout the year.

According to the Samguk Sagi (history of the three kingdoms), Byeokgolje was first built in the 21st year of the reign of King Heulhae (330 AD) of the Silla Kingdom. <br><br>However, this region belonged to the Baekje Kingdom at that time, so some counter that the embankment was actually built in the 27th year of King Biryou (330 AD) of the Baekje Kingdom. Historians agree however that the reservoir was mended by King Wonseong of Silla in 790 AD and by King Hyeonjong and King Injong of the Goryeo Dynasty in 1143 AD. In 1415, King Taejong of the Joseon Dynasty rebuilt the whole facility, but it was washed away in heavy rains five years later in the 2nd year of King Sejong.  <br><br>\n\nOnly about three kilometers of the reservoir embankment remain intact today. Moreover, the original embankment underwent major transformations in 1925 when the Dongjin Land Improvement Association remolded it into a channel for carrying water to nearby fields. <br><br>In 1975, an archeological study of the sites where the two floodgates once stood revealed that highly refined measuring techniques had been used in the original construction of the reservoir. Thus, despite its many changes, Byeokgolje not only holds significance as Korea’s oldest manmade reservoir, but also as a historical relic that points to the highly developed engineering technology of the past.",

An emergency excavation was conducted and the eight tumuli were uncovered, but unfortunately all of the tumuli except Tomb No. 1 had been severely damaged.

Behind Daeungjeon, Cheonjitap tower is located. It is the largest tower, with a x_height 3 times as high as the average adult’s x_height. How this tall tower was built is still unclear, drawing much attention from people. It is said that those stone pagodas were made in the late 1800's entirely by Lee Gapyong alone. He collected stones in daytime and built the pagodas at night. Even though the pagodas have been around for more than 100 years, they have never collapsed nor even moved through strong winds, making them truly amazing.<br>\nTapsa Temple is also well known for cherry blossoms in spring, covering an area of 1.9km from Nambu (south) parking lot of Maisan Mountain to the entrance (a 30min walk).

Cheonjitap is the main pagoda, making the other pagodas at Tapsa Temple look well-balanced. It is believed that 120 towers originally existed, but only 80 of them remain today. The two towers at the very front are named Ilgwangtap and Wolgwangtap. These groups of towers are strong enough to stand up to typhoon winds, something quite hard to believe, giving the towers a certain mystery. Also, towers are tilted slightly in both directions, showing that Lee Gapyong erected the towers with the direction of the wind in mind.",

The Daeungbojeon (the main hall) was built at this time. In 1986, the temple area (radius of 500m) was named a culturally protected area.  \n<br><br>\nOn both sides of the main gate (600m across) are large fir trees, which also line the path into the temple. As you continue down the walkway, you’ll come across a row of cherry trees. Just before the temple itself, are four gods called Sacheonwangsang that “guard” the temple. Upon reaching the temple itself (just past the guards) the first thing you’ll notice is the 1000-year-old Dangsan tree. Long ago, people used the base of the tree as a site of prayer.  \n<br><br>\nHoused in Beomjonggak is a bronze bell that can be found in many Buddhist Temples. This particular bell was made during the Goryeo Era and is engraved with three images of Buddha, called “Samjonsang.” The center building of the temple, called “Daeungbojeon” is also an artistic masterpiece, decorated with splendid colors and designs. The flower Salmun doors featuring lotus and Chrysanthemum flowers add another element of traditional beauty to the building. \n<br><br>\nOf all the temple treasures, Haewuso (meaning “a place that gets rid of worrries”) is not to be missed. True to its name, you’ll almost find yourself forgetting all your worries as you listen to the soft swaying of the surrounding bamboo grove.",

Muju Gucheondonggyegok Valley is not a deep valley. However, the valley flows through a lush forest that's quite beautiful. The calm and soothing sounds of the river are very refreshing.  \n<br>\n<br>The 33 scenic points of Gucheondonggyegok Valley are what make it so famous.  Of the 33, the most famous are Najetongmun and Sushimdae.  Najetongmun, the first scenic point is a huge boulder with a hole through it like a tunnel.  During the Samguk era, this spot once served as the border between the Silla and Baekje nations.  Because it was the dividing line between the two nations, even to this day, the east and west side's speech and customs are different.  No one knows how the hole got there, but the experience of walking through it is quite interesting. Sushimdae, the 12th scenic point, is a valley approximately 400 m in length.  It is surrounded by mountain cliffs, which makes the area resemble Geumgangsan Mountain, therefore it is often referred to as Sogeumgangsan Mountain, or little Geumgangsan Mountain.  The clear water and beautiful scenery makes this spot a must-see.  \n<br>\n<br>Many people come to Muju Gucheondonggyegok Valley for trekking. The trails go from Deogyusan National Park to Baengnyeonsa Temple.  It's a 3-hour roundtrip hike for this 6 km trail. Though it is a mountain trail, it is not that steep, making it ideal for trekking.",

At the time of their revelation, the king and queen were on their way to visit a Buddhist monk in Sajasa Temple on Yonghwasan Mountain (now known as Mireuksan Mountain). In response to their vision, the king drained the nearby pond and established Mireuksa Temple. The temple is believed to have shown the most advanced architectural and cultural skills of Baekje, Silla, and Goguryeo (the three main kingdoms at that time). Records indicate that King Jinpyeong of Silla even sent his craftsmen over to assist with the temple construction. <br><br>\n\nThe two main features of the Mireuksa Temple Site are the stone pagoda (Mireuksaji Seoktap) and the flagpole supports (Mireuksaji Dangganjiju). The 14.24-meter-high west stone pagoda (National Treasure No. 11) is the oldest and largest Korean stone pagoda in existence. The west pagoda currently has only six tiers, but is estimated to have originally had nine. The nine-story east stone pagoda (27.67m in x_height) was restored to its original stature in 1993 based on historical records. Other surviving landmarks include the flagpole supports (Treasure No. 236) to the south of the stone pagodas. The 395 centimeter-tall poles are estimated to have been created during the Unified Silla period (676-935 AD) and are set 90 meters apart from east to west.",

A long time ago, there were many tigers on Jindo Island.  When tigers began appearing frequently in the village, the people fled to Modo Island.  In the process, only the old woman Bbyong ended up remaining on the island, so the lady prayed everyday to Yongwang, the god of the ocean, to let her see her family again.  Around February, Yongwang appeared to her in her dream and said, “I will send a rainbow to the sea tomorrow; ride it and cross the ocean”.  The next day old woman Bbyong went out to the sea and prayed again, and the seawater parted as the rainbow road appeared.  Through this road, her family and the other villagers came back to the island.  Therefore when the sea parts, the people celebrate this phenomenon by holding the Yeongdeung Festival to remember the Old Woman Bbyong.

The mountain where Baengnyeonsa Temple is situated has had wild tea fields grown from Goryeo Era so that it was called ‘Dasan.’ For this reason, Jeong Yak-yong’s pen name is ‘Dasan’ which holds the valuable meaning of his banishment here.",

Unlike the tiger who gave up, the bear followed the instructions faithfully and transformed into a woman, who then married Hwanung and gave birth to Dangun.<br>\n<br> Located near Yeonguncheonbyeon in Gokseong-eup, Dangunjeon Shrine was first founded in Hakjeong-ri, Samin-dong in 1916 by Shin Tae-yun, also known as Baekdang, but later moved to its current location and went through reconstruction in 1931. An annual ancestral rite takes place at the shrine on October 3 (National Foundation Day) and March 15 to pay respects to Dangun. Dangunjeon Shrine was also a place where civilians gathered to take an oath of patriotism in action against the Japanese during Japanse colonization period; a stone plaque commemorating the March 1st Independence Movement and Baekdang Memorial Hall dedicated to Shin Tae-yun can also be found within the area.

'Ten Scenic Views of Jirisan\nMountain' are particular memorable and simply breathtaking.\n<br><Br>\nPerhaps Jirisan Mountain’s most signature highlight is its incredible sunrise; the scarlet sunlight from the horizon in the east is spectacular, and arguably the best place to watch it in Korea. The second highlight is the 'Nogodan Sea of Clouds.'  Located to the west of Jirisan \nMountain, Nogodan Peak is said to boast the most outstanding views of Jirisan \nMountain. If you climb up to the peak following the Hwaeomsa Valley, at times the sea of clouds are visible from below the peak. The third notable highlight is 'Banyabong’s Nakjo.' Banyabong Peak is a huge dome shaped feature. One of the big joys of climbing Banyabong is to see the Nakjo. The fourth selected highlight is the full moon; the beautiful scarlet sky together with the black mountain line produce an exquisite painted background to the rising of the moon. The fifth notable feature is the red sunset seen through the mountain haze. The sixth is the deep waterfall between the peaks of Cheonghakbong and Baekhakbong. The 60m fall produces a tremendous sound. The seventh of Jirisan's highlights is Piagol Autumn Leaves. At the village, walk 10 minutes further towards Piagol and you will come to a pine forest at the edge of Jeollanam-do and Gyeongsangnam-do. It is called Piagol, the best broad-leaved tree forest in Jirisan \nMountain area. In the spring, you will see the Azaleas, in the summer the green trees, and in the fall, the autumn leaves, and in the winter, the beautiful view of snow-covered landscape. But the autumnal colors of Piagol are some of the best in the world. Every year the Autumn Leaves Festival is held here. The eighth highlight is the royal azalea blossoming between the rocks. In the spring, the royal azaleas blanket the mountain. There is a field that extends 1200m in the southern area of Jirisan \nMountain covered with flowers known as Royal Azalea Plateau. The ninth feature is the Chilseon Valley. With its roots in Cheonwonbong Peak, it is one of our nation’s three best valleys. According to legend, seven gods are said to be living in Chilseondong Valley. Finally, the tenth most scenic feature is Seomjincheongryu. Flowing southwesterly across Jirisan Mountain and into the south coast, the Seomjingang River is so clear that it is sometimes compared to blue silk. The white sandy beaches on either side of the river are also very beautiful.",

Most prints here come from carnivorous dinaosaurs of the Cretaceous period. The site is famous for there being tracks from no fewer than five different dinosaurs, as well as for being one of the longest trails and most direct examples of the exact movements of the dinosaurs. The tracks of one dinosaur are the longest in the world, stretching for 40 meters. Based on the foot size of 20-22cm with a stride of approximately 90cm, it is estimated that the prints were formed by a 4-5 meter tall Koolasuchus. In addition to the canivorous dinosaurs, tracks were found of 12 herbivorous dinosaurs, as well as fossilized plants. These plants offer much assistance in the research of herbivorous dinosaur diets.",

The climate of Jeju is quite different from the temperate climate of mainland Korea. Since the island has a subtropical climate as well as a subarctic one, there are many peculiar plants that can only to be found on this island. The unique sight of Jeju Island captivates travelers. The scenery that represents this volcanic island of Jeju, such as Jusangjeolli Cliff (the pillar-shaped joint on the beach) were created by Hallasan Mountain and Oreum (parasitic cones in Jeju dialect). The piedmont area that visitors encounter on their way from the beach to Hallasan Mountain is a gift of nature and the piedmont area on the way to Geomun Oreum, where Jeju World Natural Heritage Center is located, is worth seeing. Another unique aspect here is the Jeju dialect and lifestyle.<br>\n\nTraveling the 182 km circuit road along the coastline by car, motor scooter or bike is recommended. There is a trail for walking called “Jeju Olle-gil” for those who choose to make a round trip on foot. Jeju Island is implementing more discretionary and diversified policies in politics and economy as well as tourism, and this is what makes Jeju worthy of the name “free international city.”",
