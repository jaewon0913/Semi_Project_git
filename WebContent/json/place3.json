In the Haseonam Rock region, there are places where you can stay overnight, so you can enjoy being near the water and stay the night.  Past Haseonam Rock is Jungseonam Rock, where the water currents are not strong, and many trees provide shade, so you can play in the water.  But it is not a fit place to spend the night.  From Jungseon rock, if you go travel up the river, you will come to Sangseon Rock.  This area has many interesting looking rocks, and if you go just a bit further up, you can see the Teukseon Rock. Teukseon Rock has facilities where you can spend the night. It is one of the great tour sites where you can enjoy the view of fancy rocks and clean valley water as you rest. Tourists especially frequent it in the summer looking for cool valleys and mountain water.<br><br>",

   "info": "Cheongpung Cultural Heritage Complex in Jecheon, Chungcheongbuk-do contains a variety of cultural heritages and artifacts that were collected from the region before it was flooded in 1985 during the construction of Chungjuho Lake. Here, visitors can see Hanbyeokru Pavilion, Seokjo Yeoraeipsang Buddha, Paryeongru Pavilion, Geumanmru Pavilion, Geumbyeongheon Hall, Eungcheonggak Pavilion and the Cheongpung Confucian School as well as nearly 2,000 household artifacts. It has become an outdoor museum of the glorious culture of the upper reaches of Namhangang River. <br>\n<br>\nCheongpung Cultural Heritage Complex also offers a beautiful driving course of about 10km along the road from Multae-ri to Jecheon. The driving course is a crooked road coming down along the ridges of Geumsusan Moutain. This road unveils the incredible views of unusual rock formations standing along the ridges with Cheongpung Lake City down below. Also, this road has been planted with cherry blossom trees on both sides. Beginning in mid-April, the cherry blossoms will be in full bloom just around the time for the festival, which is held in the area of Cheongpung Cultural Heritage Complex and Cheongpungho Lake. The Cheongpung Lake Cherry Blossom Festival is to host a lantern lighting event and the Yongsinje, a ceremony for the legendary dragon, on the night before the event. The main events include folk games and athletic games where many villagers and town citizens are participating to fasten the bond of the community. Other hands-on activities include cherry blossom photo shooting competition and a local food tasting where you can taste the delicacies of the region. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Hanbyeongnu Pavilion</b> (National Treasure No. 528)<br>\n The building was a government office that was built during the four-year reign of Chungsuk, king of the Goryeo Dynasty (1317), in celebration of Cheongpung-hyeon becoming Cheongpung-gun, the larger unit of the administrative district. The building collapsed due to a massive flood in 1972 and then was reconstructed in 1975 according to the original architectural style. This pavilion was constructed on a stone pillar and a column was set on the top that employs the entasis method of applying a convex curve to its surface, (or a slight convexity in its shaft). The building has a façade consisting of a total of four compartments, and three on the flank, with a column of a Korean traditional gabled building in a Jusimpo-gye style. On the right side of the building’s base, ingnang rooms on both sides of the main gate were attached with a terraced style and gambrel roofs on the top, the façade of which has five compartments, one being on the side. <br>\n<br>\n <b>Eungcheonggak</b> <br>\n The purpose of the building is still unknown, but it had stood side by side on the left side of the Hanbyeongnu Pavilion. Although there is no known established date, Lee Hwang (1501-1570), the Danyang county governor at that time, started to call it Eungcheonggak in the beginning, under the reign of King Myeong-jong.  There is also a written document left by Jeong Se-gyu, the governor of Chungcheong-do, who stayed at the pavilion in 1637. Government official Hyeon In-bok repaired the pavilion in 1990 during the 37-year reign of King Gojong. The original address was 203-1 Eup-ri, Cheongpung-myeon, but it was moved to its current location in 1983 due to the construction of the Chungju Dam. It is a two-story building where the first floor is a huge chunk of soil and stone. The house contains three compartments at the front, and both sides were built on a soil block with an angled roof that has eight sides. Also, a wooden staircase is attached on the left side of the building for ascending to the second floor. <br>\n<br>\n <b> Geumbyeongheon</b> (Chungcheongbuk-do Tangible Cultural Property No. 34) <br>\n Geumbyeongheon was previously used as a government office. Cheongpung was called Sayeori-hyeon during the three Kingdoms period of Korea, and later changed into Cheongpung-heon during the reign of King Gyeongduk of Silla. Under the reign of King Chungsuk of the Goryeo Kingdom, it became known as Jigunsa, and then later just Gun during the Joseon Dynasty under the reign of King Sejo.  Hyeonjong of the Joseon Dynasty promoted it as a protectorate of the region, and later announced it as Gun again during the reign of King Gojong. In the year 1914, all administrative districts were merged into the Cheongpung-myeon system. Government official Oh Do-il started the construction of the building, and later, government official Lee Hui-jo reconstructed it in 1705 during King Sukjong’s 31-year reign. Park Pil-mun repaired the building, and Kwon Don-in made a framed picture for the building in 1726, the second year of King Yeonjo’s ruling. <br>\n<b><br>Geumnamru Pavilion </b>(Chungcheongbuk-do Tangible Cultural Property No.20)<br>\n This place was the main gate of Cheongpung Government Office. The officer of the Cheongpung government, Cho Gil-won, named it Dohobujeoljeamun, and carved it into the stela hanging on the front of the gate during the reign of King Sunjo (1825). The office is a two-story attic containing three compartments at the front, and both sides were built on a stone foundation with an angled roof that has eight sides. Government official Hyeon In-bok started construction and later repaired it in 1956 <br>\n <br>\n<b>Flower garden </b><br>\n- Gujeolcho, Halla Gujeolcho, Haeguk, Kalimeris, Broom chrysanthemum Flower road <br>\n- Bridal Wreath Tree Roads, White Azaleas Road, Wild Ryal Azaleas Road, Satsuki Azaleas Road, Azalea Road. <br>\n<br>\n<strong>Cheongpung Husalli Old House</strong> <br>\nThis was one of the private houses located in 105 Husan-li, Cheongpung-myeon, but it was later moved to its current location due to the construction of the Chungju Dam. The structure of the house resembles the Korean symbol “ㄱ”, facing east-south and having a daecheong, a cool wooden-floor style hall, on the center.  On the right side of the daecheong, there are two small bedrooms. The toenmaru, a narrow wooden patio, is higher than average and has a fireplace underneath it. On the left side of the daecheong is the master bedroom. On the east side of the master bedroom, a special room is located to hold memorial rites for ancestors. It has a unique structure that is most commonly found in the central regions of Korea during the late Joseon Dynasty. <br>\n<br>\n<b><br>Cheongpung Dohwari Old House </b><br>\nThis was a private house built in the late Joseon Dynasty. The house used to be located in Dohwa-ri, Cheongpung-myeon, but was later moved to its current location due to the construction of the Chungju Dam. The structure of the house resembles the Korean symbol “ㄷ”. In the center of the house is a daecheong, which consists of three compartments. A bedroom, kitchen, and storage room are located on its left side, and another two bed rooms and a kitchen consisting of two compartments are on its right side.   The kitchen has signature features that are typically found in the private houses of the Taebaeksan Mountain Range, equipped with a round log chimney and a lattice window that is lit by torchlight. It is suspected that the house had an annex added to the front of the house. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Yeolliji</b><br>\nYeolliji (연리지) and yeollimok trees are famous here. If two trees grow in close proximity for a long time, they grow together, which is called yeolli, meaning “inoculation” in Korean. These trees are often compared to the concept of affectionate love, and are widely known as a “love trees,” since the two trees become united into one. They are also called either yeolliji (when the branches are connected) or yeollimok (when the trunks are connected). The yeolliji is far rarer than the yeollimok because the branches scarcely ever face each other, and even if they did, it would be easily shaken by the wind, thus making it harder to draw close to each other. Legend has it that in ancient China, birds called biikjo were often likened to the yeolliji tree. Biikjo means “a pair of birds,” a male and female that cannot fly apart from each other, as each has only one eye and one wing. It’s only when they are together that they can fly. The poet named Baekgeoi compare this with the great love story of the age, the affair of the last Tang emperor in China and his beautiful concubine, Yang Guifei (Yang Kwei-fei). In his book “Janghanga,” the couple was described as a pair of biikjo in the sky and yeollimok on the earth. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Stone Standing Buddha</b> (National Treasure No.546) <br>\nThe Stone Standing Buddha has the x_height of 341cm, the sculptural form when viewed as a whole seems to be found in late into the Unified Silla (10th century). The peaceful face of Buddha was shaped with the chubby cheeks and compassionate gaze in his eyes. The statue has a deep and long philtrum between the nose and lips and both ears that cast down to the shoulders. ‘Samdo’ referring to the three training stages of Buddhist monks, was engraved in his neck and his left hand is pointing down to the ground. The Buddha is wearing underwear with the tonggyeon Buddhist traditional clothes covering the shoulders on the top of it, which has a V-shaped knot on his belly that rests down to the chair. After building Chungju Dam, its original location was flooded and moved to its current location in 1983 and was restored here.  Cheongpung  Paryeongnu Pavilion   Tangible Cultural Property No. 35 (Designated on December 21, 1976) Paryeongnu Pavilion is a two-story gate that connects to the village of Cheongpung in the Joseon Dynasty.  Below is in the form of a door and has a tower on its top.  Min Chisang, the governor of the village at that time during the reign of Gojong (1863-1907), named the pavilion Paryeongnu, inspired by the poem that described the most spectacular eight sceneries of Cheongpung.  The gate has 3 compartments on the front and 2 on each side as well as 8-sided roofs.  The banisters surround the gate with walls and have a wooden floor inside. Apart from Paryeongnu Pavilion, Cheongpung Cultural Heritage Complex is filled with many cultural heritages such as Geumnamru, Eungcheonggak Pavilion and Geumbyeongheon. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<b>Cheongpung Hwangseongni Old house </b><br>\nThis house was originally a private housing in 164 hwangseok-li, Cheongpung-myeon and  moved to its current location after the construction of Chungju Dam. The structure of the house consists of anchae, the main building located at the center and munganchae, the gate section.  Anchae has the four compartments and two on the side with an eight-sided tiled roof on the top called giwa. Starting from west side of the house, a kitchen, master room and small bed room are stood in a row.  The master room and the room next to the kitchen are facing toenmaru, a narrow wooden porch running along the outside of a room. Another toenmaru is placed at the end of sarangbang, the guest room.<br>\n<br>\n<strong> Cheongpung Paryeongnu Pavilion</strong> (Chungcheongbuk-do's Tangible Cultural Property No. 35)<br> Paryeongnu Pavilion was the gateway of Cheongpungbu during the Joseon Dynasty. Its bottom is a gate and upper area is formed like a pavilion. It was referred to Paryeongnu as the village governor during the region of King Gojong (1863-1907), Min Chisang, wrote Paryeongsi Poetry, depicting Cheongpung's 8 Scenic Stops. It was restored on the current site in 1983 after moving locations due to Chungju Dam construction. It is comprised of three sections in front and two sections on the side. Its roof is constructed in the paljak jibung (a roof with four protruding corners) method. Inside of the pavilion, the floor was covered with wood as well as handrails. Other cultural heritage sites in the area include government offices like Geumnamru Pavilion, Eungcheonggak and Geumbyeongheon.",

   "info": "Gwanbuk-ri Relics and Busosanseong Fortress (Historic Site No. 5) is a mud fortress located on top of Busosan Mountain (alt. 106m) in the northern part of Buyeo. The fortress is estimated by some to have been built around 538 AD (16th year of King Seongwang) to protect Sabi (now Buyeo), which was once the capital of the Baekje Kingdom. Other historians, however, believe that the fortress was already in place by 500 AD (22nd year of King Dongseongwang) and modified in 605 (6th year of King Muwang) into the structure we see today. In either case, some parts of the fortress were reconstructed during the Unified Silla Kingdom period (676-935 AD) and modified again in the Goryeo (918-1392) and Joseon (1392-1910) eras. <br><br>\n\nBusosan Mountain was once considered the guardian mountain of Buyeo and is home to historic landmarks from the Baekje Kingdom (18 BC-660 AD). In addition to Busosanseong Fortress, some of the most famous sites on the mountain include Baekhwajeong Pavilion, Sajaru Pavilion, Banwollu Pavilion, Yeongillu Pavilion, Samchungsa Shrine (dedicated to three loyal subjects of the Baekje Kingdom), Gungnyeosa Shrine, Goransa Temple, Gunchangji (military warehouse site), and Suhyeoljugeoji (site of pit houses for the Baekje soldiers). The mountain is also home to Nakhwaam Rock where, according to legend, 3,000 women of the Baekje Kingdom threw themselves into the river below after the collapse of the empire.\n<br><br><strong>Historic Sites of Busosan Mountain</strong><br><br>■ Samchungsa Shrine <br>\nSamchungsa Shrine is just a short hike from Sabimun, the main gate of Busosanseong Fortress. The shrine holds the portraits and memorial tablets of Seongchung, Heungsu, and Gyebaek, who were known as the three most loyal subjects of the Baekje Kingdom. Memorial services are held for these great patriots during the annual Baekje Cultural Festival each October.\n<br><br>■ Yeongillu Pavilion<br>\nYeongillu Pavilion was built on the site of Yeongildae, an observation platform located on the easternmost peak of Busosan Mountain. Kings and members of the royal family of the Baekje Kingdom once used this spot as a place from which to watch the sun rise above Yeoncheonbong Peak on Gyeryongsan Mountain, plan state affairs, and pray for the peace of the kingdom and their subjects.\n<br><br>■ Gunchangji<br>\nAlso known as “Mallichang,” Gunchangji is the site of a warehouse that was used to store grain for military use. Remnants of burnt grain were discovered at the site in 1915.\n<br><br>■ Suhyeoljugeoji <br>\nSuhyeoljugeoji, only a short distance from Gunchangji, was once the site of a pit house for soldiers of the Baekje Dynasty. The thatched-roof pit houses that stand on the site today have been reconstructed based on historical evidence uncovered during site excavation. Measuring 1m in depth with walls of wood and straw, the pit houses are neighbored by an exhibition hall that stands on the original excavation site. \n<br><br>■ Sajaru Pavilion<br>\nSajaru Pavilion, located on the highest peak of Busosan Mountain (alt. 106m), is said to represent the cosmic powers of yin and yang together with Yeongillu Pavilion in the east. Adorned with a nameplate written by Prince Uichinwang Yi Gang (1877-1955), Sajaru commands an ethereal view of the moon and has long since been the source of poetic inspiration. The pavilion was also the site of discovery of the famous Geumdong-seokga-yeorae-ipsang (Gilt-bronze Standing Buddha, Treasure No. 196). <br><br>■ \nBaekhwajeong Pavilion<br>\nBaekhwajeong Pavilion, perched on the cliffs of Nakhwaam Rock, was built in 1929 by a poets’ society called Bupungsisa to commemorate the story of the famous rock. According to the historical tale, the women of Baekje flung themselves off the cliffs of Nakhwaam to their deaths after the kingdom collapsed to keep themselves from being defiled by the men of the insurgent kingdoms.<br><br>■ \nGungnyeosa Shrine<br>\nGungnyeosa Shrine is located a short distance from Taejagol (Crown Prince Valley) to the northeast of Banwollu Square.

   "info": "Below Seongheungsanseong Fortress (built in 501 during the Baekje Kingdom) in Buyeo is an ancient temple called Daejosa (great bird temple). &nbsp;Inside the temple grounds stands a giant standing stone Buddha statue looking toward the east. The temple, which was founded during the&nbsp;5th year of the Baekje Kingdom, has an interesting legend behind its origin. <br><br>According to the legend, an old monk fell asleep after praying under a large rock on the slopes of Seongheungsan Mountain. In his dream, a large bird glowing in gold  flew in from the west and sat on the rock where Daejosa currently stands. While the bird continuoulsy flapped its wings, a ray of light shone on the rock and it was there that the statue of Avalokitasvara Bodhisattva appeared. \n<br><br>The old monk had the same dream at the same time for many days. He recounted his dream to the seongju (castle lord), who then reported it to King Seong of Baekje. The king interpreted the dream as a sign that it was the right time to move the capital of Baekje to Sabi (now Buyeo) and ordered the construction of a large temple at the location that appeared in the dream. The temple was so big that even at a hurried pace, it would still take 10 years to build. Workers had to work day and night, and every time the workers felt tired, birds would come singing to brighten up the atmosphere so that the workers can forget the fatigue and continue working. Hence, the temple was completed after only&nbsp;five years. Because of the golden bird, the temple was named Daejosa, literally meaning \"temple of a great bird.\"<br><br> \nThe rock on which Avalokitasvara Bodhisattva appeared in the dream was recreated as a stone statue of a Buddha. This standing stone Maitreya Bodhisattva statue is a fine work of sculpture which, along with the stone Bodhisattva of Gwanchoksa Temple (Treasure No. 218), is a representative heritage of the early Gorye period.<br><br>In front of Wontongbojeon Hall (a hall enshrining Avalokitasvara Bodhisattva) stands a pagoda. In the old days, the stone pagoda used to have only the cover stones but as the pagoda body stones were found, the structure was completely restored in 1975. This pagoda is assumed to have been built in the early days of the Goryeo Kingdom.",

While basking in the moonlight, people will hear the sound of a flock of wild ducks flying together. In this ordinary-looking  village, the long-standing tradition of Hansan mosi (ramie fabric) is \npassed down and preserved in the hands of the village women. \n<br><br>\nHansan mosi is also called 'semosi' (fine ramie) because of the time-consuming \nand labor-intensive process involved. The village offers a variety of mosi-themed \nexperience programs for visitors. Village artisans  with valuable mosi-related \nexperience assist the participants.  Programs include ramie plant harvesting and ramie fabric weaving. \nVisitors can also try some highly nutritious  ramie rice cakes and tea.\n<br><br>\nMosi's history can be traced back as far as the period of the Three Kingdoms.  It is said \nthat during&nbsp;the  Baekje Dynasty, an old man  found the ramie plant at the foot of Geonjisan Mountain after a mountain god appreared in his dream. The natural fabric, mosi, is so thin and delicate that it is compared to \nthe wings of a dragonfly. In&nbsp;the  Goryeo Dynasty, the king presented the China's \nking with Hansan mosi. In the Joseon Dynasty, mosi was was offered to the kings.<br><br>\nOne can see the difference between mosi and regular fabric by trying on mosi \nclothes made by the artisans. Experience programs at the village also include natural dyeing, making mosi jegi (object used to play jegichagi) and mosi mobile phone accessories. Food made from mosi plants include mosi buchimgae (Korean pancake) and mosi bread.\n<br><br>\nAnother fun activity at the village is <i>hangwa</i> (traditional sweets & cookies) making. Hangwa-making, \nmuch like producing mosi, is a labor-intensive process. In making hangwa, grains harvested at the village \nare used. The grains are fried for a short time, carefully mixed with honey, and then \nflattened. After it cools down and hardens, it is then cut into small pieces. The taste of freshly-made hangwa adds to the joy \nof the experience, making it the best activity of the program.",

Some suggest that it was built around 527 A.D. during the 5th year of King Seongwang’s reign, but there is little evidence to support this theory. The only reference alluding to a specific time is Yeojidoseo (‘Detailed Survey of Korean Geography’ published during the late Chosun Dynasty). It states the Jeongamsa Temple location as on Oseosan Mountain, and Oseosan Mountain being surrounded by Hongsan Mountain and Baekwolsan Mountain and intersected by Hongju, Gyeolseong, and Boryeong. This indicates the temple was recognized in the mid-18th century and around the same time, Garamgo (a book about temples, published in the late 18th century) also states that Geongamsa Temple is located approximately 11km to the east of Gyeolseong-hyeon. It is still uncertain whether the temple referred to is Jeongamsa Temple on Oseosan Mountain. <br>\nNonetheless, some foundation stones measure 70-80cm on each side. These stones indicate the old Buddhist shrine of Jeongamsa Temple was laid out with five rooms at the front and three rooms on the side.

Topographically, it features nearly 40 valleys and is divided into the Southwest Mountain, a sacred place during the Silla period, and the Southeast Mountain, where many Buddhas can be found around the valleys. \n<br><br>\nNajeong Well, at the western foot of Namsan Mountain, is the mythic birthplace of King Park Hyeokgeose, founder of the Silla Kingdom. The local Yangsanjae Shrine was built in honor of its founder who lived in Seorabeol before the Silla Kingdom was established. Poseokjeong Pavilion is the place where the glorious era of the Silla Kingdom came to an end. In the Southeast Mountain region, one can encounter the Seated Buddha of Borisa Temple, a 9-meter Bulmusa Stone Buddha Statue, and a Seated Stone Buddha at Gamsil Shrine. <br><br>Namsan Mountain also features 12 treasures, including Mireukgol Seated Stone Buddha, a three-storey stone pagoda in Yongsangsa Temple, the Maae Stone Buddha in Chilbulam Temple, and others. There are also twelve historic sites, such as the site of Poseokjeong Pavilion, Najeong Well, and Samneung Royal Tombs, as well as nine local tangible cultural properties (Maaegwaneumbosalsang Buddha in Samneunggol Valley, Ipgolseokbul Buddha, Yaksugol Maaeipsang Buddha, and others), and one important piece of folklore material. \n<br><br>\nNamsan Mountain is also famous for its scenic landscapes in addition to its cultural heritage. Numerous valleys, unique rock formations, and beautiful trails are abundant throughout the area. Many tourists say, “You cannot say that you know Gyeongju without hiking up Namsan Mountain.” Namsan Mountaint is a place where the scenic nature and long history of the Silla Kingdom coexist, and also where the aesthetic consciousness and religious traditions of the Silla people evolved into the artform it is today.",

The temple was originally called ‘Hwaeom Bulguksa Temple’ or ‘Beopryusa Temple’ and was rebuilt by Kim Dae-Seong (700-774), who started rebuilding the temple in 751 during the reign of King Gyeong-Deok (r. 742-765) and completed it in 774 during the reign of King Hye-Gong (r. 765-780). Upon completion, the temple’s name was changed to Bulguksa. <br>\n <br>\n Bulguksa Temple underwent numerous renovations from the Goryeo Dynasty (918-1392) to the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910), but was burned down during the Imjin War (Japanese Invasions, 1592-1598). <br>\n <br>\n Reconstruction started again in 1604 during the 37th year of King Seon-jo’s reign (Joseon Dynasty) and was renovated about 40 times until 1805 (during the reign of King Sun-Jo, 1790-1834). After this time, the temple suffered serious damage and was often the target of robbers. <br>\n <br>\n In 1969, the Bulguksa Temple Restoration Committee was formed and in 1973, Mulseoljeon, Gwaneumjeon, Birojeon, Gyeongru, and Hoerang (all of which had previously been demolished) were rebuilt. Other old or broken sites (such as Daeungjeon, Geungnakjeon, Beomyeongnu and Jahamun) were repaired. <br>\n <br> Even today, Bulguksa Temple is home to many important cultural relics such as Dabotap Pagoda (National Treasure No. 20), Seokgatap Pagoda (National Treasure No. 21), Yeonhwa-gyo & Chilbo-gyo Bridges (National Treasure No. 22), Cheongun-gyo & Baegun-gyo Bridges (National Treasure No. 23), Seokguram Grotto (National Treasure No. 24),&nbsp;the Golden Seated Vairocana Buddhist Figure (National Treasure No. 26), the Golden Seated Amita Figure (National Treasure No. 27), and Saritap Pagoda (Treasure No. 61).",

Kim Yusin then went on to defeat the Baekje Kingdom in cooperation with the Tang Dynasty, also later conquering the Goguryeo Kingdom in the year 668.<br><br>\n\nThe Tang Dynasty turned against Silla after the collapse of Goguryeo, but was defeated by Kim Yusin’s army in cooperation with the armies of Goguryeo and Baekje. With the fall of the Tang, Kim Yusin finally realized his dream of unifying the three kingdoms and was appointed the highest government post in Silla in honor of his heroic achievement.<br><br>\n\nThe tomb of General Kim Yusin is a large tomb measuring roughly 30m in diameter. The relief carvings of 12 Oriental zodiac gods (half man, half animal) stand guard around the tomb, brandishing weapons. The elaborately decorated tomb is second in grandeur only to those of royalty, further underscoring Yusin’s major contribution in unifying the three kingdoms.\n<br>\n\n<br>The path to this tomb is also a sight not to be missed. The street leading up to the tomb is called Heungmu-ro, and has been selected as one of the 100 Most Beautiful Streets in Korea. The street is full of cherry blossoms in spring and is famous for being a great place to take a walk or go for a drive.",

With the construction of Sudo Bridge, the Single Log Bridge was no longer needed, but was rebuilt some time later in its original form. To celebrate the bridge’s impressive history, each year the Oenamu Dari Festival (literally, “Single Log Bridge Festival”) is held in October.",

The king opened the box and found a small child inside, Kim Alji. The forest, which had previously been called ‘Sirim’ or ‘Gurim’, became known as ‘Gyerim’, ('gye’ meaning rooster). The name Gyerim was also used to refer to the Silla kingdom. \n\n<br>Alji was adopted as the king’s son, but because the crown was passed on to King Pasa of the Park family, he never ascended the throne.

   "info": "The site of Hwangnyongsa Temple is located in front of the Bunhwangsa Temple in Guhang-dong, Gyeongju. During the Silla Era, the Hwangnyongsa Temple was the nation’s largest temple and housed the bulk of the country’s major Buddhist treasures.   \n  \n<br>Construction of the temple began in 553 on a field near the royal compound of Banwolseong under the commission of King Jinheung. The king originally planned to build a palace, but decided to build a temple instead, after receiving reports that a yellow dragon had been spotted on the building site. The temple was thus named Hwangnyongsa (Temple of Yellow Dragon) and was completed in 569, seventeen years after construction began. The temple murals feature an old pine tree drawn by Artist Solgeo. During the Silla Era, the temple was the center of state-sanctioned Buddhism.  \n  \n<br>Later, when monk Jajang was studying in Tang, he came across a god as he was passing by the Taihe Pond. The god said to him, “the yellow dragon, which is my eldest son, is guarding Hwangnyongsa Temple upon orders of Brahma, the Creator. If you build a nine-story pagoda upon your return to Silla, the neighboring states will surrender and pay tribute, and the royal cause will be stronger. Once the construction of the pagoda is complete, prepare a memorial service for the local gods and pardon any of the country's criminals. If you follow all I have told you, no other state will dare invade Silla.” <br> \n\nAfter this encounter, Jajang returned to Silla and convinced Queen Seondeok to build the nine-story pagoda. Master architect Abiji of the neighboring state Baekje designed the pagoda and the project was built by Yongchun and his 200 men using wood and stone. The night before the columns were to be erected, Architect Abiji of Baekje dreamed of the fall of Baekje and refused to complete the project. With a peal of thunder, an old monk and a man of great strength suddenly appeared from the temple's main hall, erected the columns, and magically disappeared. Abiji was so shocked at the sight that he accepted his country’s future demise as the fate of the gods and once again restarted work on the temple. (From Samgungnyusa, the Memorabilia of the Three Kingdoms) \n\n<br>In the twenty-three years following the completion of the pagoda, Queen Seondeok unified the Three Kingdoms; later, numerous scholars pointed to the pagoda as a contributing factor in the unification. Of the three treasures of Silla (the Jangyukjonsang statue, the nine-story pagoda of Hwangnyongsa Temple, and the Heavenly Belt of King Jinpyeong) two were located at the Hwangnyongsa Temple. The largest bell of Silla was also in Hwangnyongsa, but was taken away during the Mongol invasion. The highest monks of Silla preached at the temple, and many kings came to listen to the Buddhist teachings. <br>\n  \nDuring excavation work in July 1969, the massive foundation stones of the sermon hall, auditorium, and pagoda were found. Eight years of archaeological excavations and studies revealed the unique layout of the temple grounds, which consisted of one pagoda and three halls; also found were 40,000 or so ancient artifacts. Though foundation stones and other structures from the bottom of the temple were identified through excavation, there are no historical clues about the temple’s upper design, making the restoration of the temple in its entirety practically impossible. The size of the temple, based on archeological findings, was about 70 acres, roughly 8 times that of the Bulguksa Temple.\n<br>&nbsp;",

The mouse told the King to “follow after the crow” for an easy journey. So, the King and his servant (who was traveling with him) followed the crow, but became distracted and lost their way. As they were wandering about a pond (now known as Seochulji), an old man appeared from the waters’ depths and presented an envelope to the King. Based on the message in the envelope, the King instructed his servant to fire an arrow at the Geomungo (Korean musical instrument) case nearby. The shot killed the queen and a monk who had been hiding there, both of whom had been hatching a plot against the King. \n<br><br>\nThe name of the pond, “Seochulji” (literally meaning “writing from the pond”) originates from this legend. It is said that a man named Imjeok built a building by the pond in the 5th year of King Hyeonjong (1664) to enjoy the scenery. The simple, yet elegant building still remains at the northwest of the pond.",

The temple was built in the Silla era and, with 16 buildings, is the second largest temple after Bulguksa. <br>\nLegend has it that the temple was originally built by the Venerable Gwang-yu, a sage from India, in the early part of the Silla Kingdom. The temple was reportedly called ‘Imjeongsa’ at first, but was later changed to ‘Girimsa’ after undergoing expansive renovations by Monk Wonhyo. It is still unclear exactly what year the temple was built in.   \n\n<br><br>Girimsa is divided into two main areas. The first is the area around Daejeokgwangjeon Hall where the statue of Birojanabul is enshrined. The second is the area around the majestic 500-year-old bo tree (a kind of large fig tree) that is home to a wooden pagoda, the Seongbo Museum, Samsingak, Mangbujeon, and Gwaneumjeon halls. The Daejeokgwangjeon Hall was first built during Queen Seondeok's reign, and was rebuilt six times since its original construction. Its simple but majestic architecture is characterized by baeheullim (aka, entasis columns) and a Dapoyangsik (Dapo-style) single-tiered gabled roof. \n\n<br>Girimsa is famous for Ojongsu, water that is said to have five different tastes. It consists of gamrosu, which is best for making tea; hwajeongsu, which supposedly gives comfort to the drinker; janggunsu, which makes the body stronger; myeongansu, which gives clear vision; and otaksu, which is said to sparkle so brightly that it attracts all the birds of the air. During Japanese colonial rule, the source of janggunsu, literally meaning ‘water of a general,’ was reportedly blocked off by Japanese soldiers, who were afraid the water would give the Korean people the strength to overthrow them. Except for janggunsu, water still continues to flow from each source. <br>\n\nOn the way to Girimsa temple is the Golgulsa Temple, well known for its 12 grottos. Golgulsa was originally a hermitage (monastery) of Girimsa. After becoming an independent institution, it became the center of Seonmudo practice in Korea.

The first section is the Namsan Area, a treasure trove of Buddhist art masterpieces dating back to the Silla Kingdom. Gyeongju Namsan Mountain (often referred to as an ‘outdoor museum’) is home to many historical heritage sites from the Silla Kingdom. Major attractions include: Poseokjeong (Historic Site No.1), Tapgok Maaejosanggun (Treasure No. 201), Cheollyongsaji Three-story Stone Pagoda (Treasure No. 1188), Chilbulam Maae Stone Buddha (Treasure No. 200), Bulgok Seated Stone Buddha (Treasure No. 198), and 37 other Buddhist relics<br>\n<br>\nThe second section is the Wolseong Area, one of the former palace sites of the Silla Kingdom. The area consists of Gyerim (Historic Site No. 19); Donggung Palace and Wolji (Historic Site No. 18), a Silla Royal Palace site; and Cheomseongdae (National Treasure No. 31), the oldest observatory in the East. Daereungwon area, the third area, features a cluster of the royal graves of the Kings and Queens of Silla. <br>\n<br>\nAlso in the same area are Gobungun (a cluster of old graves) in Nodong-ri (Historic Site No. 38), Gobungun (a cluster of old graves) in Noseo-ri (Historic Site No. 39) Gobungun (a cluster of old graves) in Hwangnam-ri (Historic Site No. 40), and Oreung (Historic Site No. 172), among others. Archaeologists have discovered a number of invaluable relics and historic items in this area such as Geumgwan (golden crown), Cheonmado (a painting of flying horses), and numerous pottery pieces. These finds are perhaps the greatest clues into the life of the people of the Silla Dynasty.<br>\n<br>\nArea number four, the Hwangnyongsa Area, is where the former site of the Hwangnyongsa Temple (Historic Site No. 246) and Bunhwangsa Stone Pagoda are located. Lastly, is the Sanseong Area, housing remnants of the major defense system for the capital city. The site consists of Myeonghwalsanseong Fortress (Historic Site No. 47) which is estimated to be around 400 years old.<br>\n<br>\nThe Gyeongju Historic Area has a total of 52 designated cultural assets that are registered as World Cultural Heritages.<br>\n<br>&nbsp;",

A painting of the caving titled \"Golgulseokgul\" by Gyeomjae Jeongseon, a famous painter of the era, revealed that there was once a wooden room located in front of the Maebul, but today only a hint of the room remains on the rock. The head of the Buddha (Yukgye) is perched solid and high on the body with a clear profile of the face – sharp eyes, small lips and a long and narrow nose. In contrast to the three-dimensional face, the body is broader and flatter. The neck and upper chest sections have eroded over time. The folds in the clothing are nearly parallel, and the arm area has a v-pattern wrinkle, giving it a more realistic and three-dimensional quality. Around the head of the Buddha is a lotus-shaped halo, while the body is surrounded by a rhythmic flame-like halo. The Maebul is believed to have been created during the late Unified Silla Kingdom, as it shows similar craftsmanship to Seated Stone Vairocana Buddha (National Treasure No. 995), which was created in the year 876 and is located in Chukseosa Temple.",

In ancient times, the higher and larger a tomb, the higher the social status of the person buried inside. Given this tradition and historical evidence, the largest tomb in the south has been identified as Geumnim Wangneung (Royal Tomb of King Geumnim); the other large tombs are also presumed to be those of the kings of Daegaya. The large royal tombs (over 20m in diameter) dominate the mountain ridge (the highest point) while mid-sized and smaller tombs can be found on the mountain slopes and foothills. <br><br>\n\n\n\nHistorical research on Daegaya began with the excavation and partial identification of the ancient tombs of Goryeong by research teams from Kyungpook National University and Keimyung University in 1977. Excavators discovered a great number of relics—gilt-bronze crowns, swords, armor, and trinkets of gold, silver, and jade—that shed light on the flourishing culture of Gaya. <br><br>\n\n\n\nTo continue to encourage interest in the history and culture of Daegaya, officials of Goryeong-gun County established the Daegaya Royal Tomb Exhibit Hall at the foot of Jusan Mountain in Gobun-gun, Jisan-dong.

These days it is known as Haegeumgang \nRiver, meaning  Geumgangsan Mountain in the sea.\n<br><br>\nThe most stunning scenery of Haegeumgang River is the sunset and sunrise and can be best viewed on Ilwollbong Peak or Lion Rock.  There is Shipjagul Cave in the center of Haegeumgang \nRiver, which is 100m long from east to west and 180m long from south to north. It has been called Shipjagul (meaning ‘cross’ in Korean) Cave because it looks like a cross when viewed from the sky.  If you go on the tour, you will be fascinated by the x_height of the rock walls and the inside of the cave.  A long time ago, scholars expressed their yearning for the beauty of nature by writing and reading poems they wrote on sailboats with a bowl of makkoli (rice wine) in their hands.\n<br><br>\nWhen you take a ship around the island, you’ll be fascinated once more because of the great works such as the Maitreya Rock, which reflects on Eunjin Maitreya, Candlestick Rock and the 1,300 year old guardian pine tree of Haegeumgang \nRiver.<br><br>",

Since becoming \nthe King of Gaya in 521 CE, he reigned for 11 years until he handed over his \ncountry to King Beopheung of the Silla Kingdom in 532 CE.<br><br>There are two \ndifferent scholarly opinions  about this tomb. One is that it should be classified&nbsp;as a stone pagoda and the \nother, a royal tomb. The reason why this was regarded as a pagoda is \nthat there are similarly shaped stone pagodas in the Andong and Uiseong regions. \nThe basis for it being called Wangreung, or royal tomb, is that there is a record in Dongguk Yeoji Seongram (an \nancient history book published during the rule of King Seongjong in the Joseon Dynasty) and \nin Saneum-hyeon Sancheonjo (a record of events in the region) of it being a \ntomb. The \nnotes state that \"there is a structure with steps on \nthe four faces, in the form of nine dragons piled up of stones at a distance \nof about 16 km (40 ri&nbsp;in traditional Korean scale) from the village, so \npeople believe it must be a royal tomb\".<br><br> The record describing the name of the king buried \nin this tomb can be extracted from a record of travels called Wangsan Shimreunggi \nwritten by Hong Ui Young, a Joseon Dynasty scholar. In addition, there’s also \nan entry&nbsp; in Wangsansagi, a book on the history of Wangsansa Temple (a \ntemple located  west of the tomb) that the person buried in the tomb is King Guhyeong.<br><br>Unlike ordinary \ngraves, the tomb is built at&nbsp;the middle part of the hill's slope. The tomb \nhas a unique appearance made up of steps and layers, with the highest point \nbeing 7.15 meters high. There are seven layers at the front and no steps at \nthe back due to it being built on an inclined surface. The overall shape of \nthis tomb is different from the pyramids built on level ground.  The top of the tomb is  oval in \nshape. At the center, there is a stone tablet with the words \"Royal Tomb of King Yang of the \nGarak Nation\". In front of the tomb, there are several stone pieces that \nhave been added to the original tomb. <br><br>During the 17th Year of King \nJeongjo of the Joseon Dynasty (1793), a wooden box that was passed down from generation \nto generation in Wangsansa<i> </i>Temple was discovered. The box contained portraits \nof King Guhyeong and his queen, their clothes, an archery bow, and other objects. To \npreserve these, a royal building called Deogyangjeon Hall was \nconstructed. To this date, a memorial service is held here in spring and \nautumn of every year.<br>\n&nbsp;<br>",

Iljumun Gate was the first gate that every sattva must pass to become a Buddha and considered as a representative work of ancient architecture.  Daejeokgwangjeon, the grand sanctuary, and the three-story stone pagoda in the yard possess the majestic appearance of the one thousand-year-old temple.  Since the 23rd year of Goryeo Dynasty (year 1236), it took 16 years to finish the Tripitaka Koreana, the most famous national treasure of Haeinsa Temple, which was made as a wish to overcome the national crisis caused by Mongolia Invasion.  The printing blocks are 68cm wide, 24.5cm long, 3 cm thick with wood fixed at each end to maintain balance and lacquer was applied to prevent corrosion.  Silver magnolias growing near the South Sea and Geojae area were cut down, soaked in sea water for several years and then dried to make these printing blocks.

The blue and yellow colors layered in the rocks tell a unique history of the terrain.  A stairway from the road leads directly to the lookout point. <br> Just past a gas station along the coastal highway, Sinseondae Observatory reveals itself.  Walking out onto the rocks of Sinseondae, views of the surrounding islands and incredible landscape open up to viewers.

They are the largest natural swamps in South Korea, with a total size of about 5,550 square km. The bottom of the swamp is shallower than 1m and there are over 1,000 species living in its murky waters.  It has a primitive atmosphere with 100 kinds of plants containing 28 kinds of aquatic plants and 72 types of hydrophytes. <br>\n<br>\n Upo Wetland is a primitive low bed wetland, which was created about 140 million years ago. When soft ground collapsed, water started to come to a low basin, a lake where dinosaurs lived 100 million years ago.  Upo Wetland was formed in with the sediments from the mountains brought in by rivers. From the outer edge, the current Upo Wetland is going through a natural alteration and ecological succession from a lake to swamp and from grass-covered plain to a forest. At Upo Wetland there are eight famous locations to see fireflies, constellation gazing, and willow groves, but there are&nbsp;many other interesting things to see. The Upo rain-fog is an especially eye-catching natural phenomenon, becoming visible when there is no wind, when skies are clear, and the temperature difference between daytime and nighttime is 10 degrees or more. The fireflies come out around&nbsp;20:00-21:00 in August and September. In winter, migrating birds spend their winter here and you can watch about 33 species of birds such as swans, whopper swans, bean geese, teals and wild ducks. It is&nbsp;recommend to go for&nbsp;a walk in the evening or early in the morning rather than&nbsp;during the daytime.<br>",
