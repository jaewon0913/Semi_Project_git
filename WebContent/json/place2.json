This is a mountain fortress built along the surrounding three mountain peaks in the westernmost and southernmost parts of Mt. Unjusan (460m in elevation). The fortress, which borders 3 villages in Jeondong-myeon and 2 villages in Jeonui-myeon, consists of a 3,098m-long outer fortress wall and 543m-long inner fortress wall. Both the outer and inner fortress walls are built with stone. \n<br><br>\nConsidering the number of formerly inhabited sites that have been unearthed, it is obvious that there were many buildings in the fortress and the surrounding hills. In the fortress, many broken pieces of earthenware from the Baekje period, porcelain from the Goryeo and Joseon periods, and broken tile from the Baekje, Goryeo and Joseon periods have been discovered. \n<br><br>\nMountain trails have been improved for family hikers. The mountain peak has a great view of the Independence Hall of Korea, Asan Bay, and the downtown areas of Cheonan and Cheongju. It takes about 2 hours to reach the peak.",

The mountain’s slope is steep and stones used in the construction of the fortress walls are scattered here and there at the summit.

   "info": "The Hwaseong Fossilized Dinosaur Egg Site (화성 공룡알 화석지) was discovered on an island in the tidal plain south of Sihwaho Lake (시화호). The island was revealed when seawaters were blocked during a land reclamation project. As a sedimentary layer formed during the Cretaceous period of the Mesozoic Era (dated around 83 million to 85 million years ago) was eroded by weathering, around twenty 50-60 cm diameter nests and roughly 130 dinosaur eggs ranging in size from 11 to 14 cm, located at six to seven sites, were discovered. It is anticipated that more fossils will be discovered once a thorough investigation is carried out and more land is reclaimed.\n<br><be>\nMost dinosaur eggs are oval shaped and dark red. Considering the properties of the fossilized shells, the eggs that have been discovered so far are assumed to belong to four-legged herbivorous dinosaurs with a long neck and tail, and two-legged herbivorous dinosaurs, including the Hadrosaur. A wide range of plant fossils were also discovered alongside the fossilized eggs, leading to expectations that the formerly lush environment may yet be restored.\n<br><br>\nThe discovery of the Fossilized Dinosaur Egg Site in Hwaseong has greatly expanded the scope of Korean paleontology; previous paleontological discoveries were exclusively limited to fossilized dinosaur footprints.

   "info": "Aegibong Peak is located at the northern tip of Gimpo City about an hour’s drive from the downtown area. The mountain is where North and South Korea engaged in a fierce battle at the end of the Korean War; after the battle, Korea was divided into two nations. Since the peak is still a restricted area, visitors must present their passport in order to be admitted. From the peak, an open view of North Korean territory unfolds below and visitors can see South Korean territory as far as Songhaksan Mt. in Chungcheongnamdo Province. \n<br><br>\nEven before the Korean War, Aegibong carried much historical significance as the setting of the sad love story between the governor of Pyeongyang and his mistress. The two lovers were separated during the Sino-Korean War in 1636 and the peak (‘Ae, 애’ means love, ‘gi, 기’ mistress in Korean) was named in honor of their love. \n<br><br>\nIn 1968, president Park Cheong Hee visited the peak and wrote a note by hand, saying the mistress' pain of being separated from her lover because of the war was much like those of families separated by the division of the two Koreas. The president’s writing was carved in a tablet and placed at the peak, where separated families still come every thanksgiving to perform an ancestral ritual and wish for reunification. \n<br><br>\n<br><br>\nAt the foot of the mountain, Han River empties into the ocean along the west coast, which is expressed by the term 'Jogang (조강)‘ (‘grandfather river’ in Korean). The scenery of the river with its boats, surrounding islands, and converging estuaries creates a unique and cozy scene that seems to be in harmony with the image of a kindly grandfather.  \n<br><br>\nENTRANCE TO PEAK<br>\n1) Only those traveling by car will be admitted.<br>\n**Entrance will not be granted to those traveling on foot or by bike.<br>\n2) All visitors are required to show their passport.<br>\n**Korea citizens may show their government-issued ID instead of their passport.<br>\n3) Visitors must be fluent in Korean or accompanied by someone who can speak Korean fluently.<br>\n4) Fill in the tour request form and submit it to the office at the entrance.<br> \n**All visitors must show ID; choose 1 person to fill out the form on behalf of your party.<br>\n<br>\nPOINTS OF INTEREST<BR> \n1) View of North Korean territory through telescope<br> \n2) Naval War Monument<br> \n3) Navy promotion video<br> \n4) Lecture on Aegibong (reservations required)",

On the slopes of Soyosan Mountain rest shrines commemorating Wonhyo and Uisang, two renowned Buddhist monks from the Silla Kingdom, and the Jajae Hermitage, a small temple where Wonhyo practiced asceticism. There are many small waterfalls including Wonhyo Falls, Uisang Falls, Cheongnyang Falls, and Seonnyeotang Falls, which are popular destinations for visitors in the summer. Although Nahanjeon, a natural stone cave, and Geumsonggul Cave, halfway up the mountain, still maintain an air of mystery. \n<br><br>\nMoving from the base of the mountain, past the parking lot and shops, and following the flat path, you will find Jajae Hermitage; and, after going a bit further, you will find Wonhyo Falls cascading down between the rocky cliffs. Below the fall is Songni Bridge, which leads straight to the Uisangdae site (587m) at the top of the mountain. The left path off of the bridge leads to a cliff that is the Wonhyodae site; and by following a forest path between rising rock walls, you can trek to the Jajae Hermitage, next to which is a small cave called Nahanjeon. Very tasty spring water wells in the cave and it is called Wonhyo Spring, and its waters are famous for making excellent tea.",

The garden was conceptualized by Professor Han Sang-kyung (Gardening Department, Sahmyook University) while he was serving as an exchange professor in America. His vision was to create a garden that would become world-famous and spread the concept of Korean beauty throughout the world. The inspiration for the garden stemmed from a poem written by Sir Tagore, a great Indian poet, who described Korea during the Joseon Dynasty as \"The Land of the Morning Calm.\" <br>\n<br>\n The garden is the oldest private garden in Korea. It is an artistic space with a beautiful balance between the Korean concept of natural curves with asymmetry, and plants with synthetic materials, attracting about 600,000 visitors annually. <br>\n<br>\n Scenic walkways, beautifully manicured grass, and flower beds connect the garden's 20 different themed sections. The Sunken Garden is shaped like the Korean Peninsula and is carpeted with beautiful flowers on both sides representing the desire for South and North Korea to be reunited. It is easily one of the most popular and meaningful attractions at the garden. <br>\n<br>\n The garden houses about 5,000 kinds of plants, including 300 varieties native to Baekdusan Mountain, known as a spiritual mountain to the Korean people. Flowers are in bloom from March to November, so the garden is usually busy during this period. In addition to the beautiful foliage of the garden, there are a variety of festivals and displays held throughout the year. <br>\n<br>\n * Spring: Spring Garden Festival <br>\n * Summer:  Festival of Roses, Hydrangeas and Roses of Sharon <br>\n * Autumn:  Festival of Chrysanthemums and Autumnal Tints <br> * Winter:  Lighting Festival",

Nestled in Joan-myeon of Namyangju-si, Gyeonggi-do, the temple has a commending view over Bukhangang River, which is rated to have one of the top&nbsp;magnificent views. Thanks to this geological reason, visitors here can hear clearer sounds of bell ringing from the temple, and the soothing water streaming down the mountain peaks and valley. It is no coincident that the place was named after this define sound-effect, thus called <em>sujong</em>, which directly translates into 'water-bell.'<br>\n There is another folklore that has been passed down for generations, with regards to the origin of the temple's name. When King Sejo (1417-1468) was returning from the Geumgangsan Mountain trip, he stayed a night in the current Yangsu-ri region, and had heard the bell ring from afar. On the next day, he had his courtiers to look for the bell-ringing&nbsp;source but only ended up&nbsp;finding a cave, where water falling from the cave's ceiling has been making the the supposed 'bell-ringing' sound. Besides the discovery of the cave, King Sejo also found 18 small Buddha statues. To commemorate the excavation, the king ordered to construct a temple at the very site.<br>\n <br>\n Visitors will not be able to see these valuables on-site currently, but still be able to enjoy beautiful sights of Ungilsan Mountain and learn some historical facts. The artifacts from the temple site are now managed by and exhibited at the National Museum of Korea. Although the exact date of the temple's foundation has not been proven yet, experts estimated the period to be during the early Joseon Dynasty (1392-1910).",

Father Kim was executed at the age of 26 and was not permitted a funeral. But, 40 days after the execution, Vincentius Lee Minsik was able to steal away Kim’s body with great difficulty; he carried it on his back eventually burying it in Mirinae – dismissing all advisement and council that urged him against this. At the center of the site stands a grand memorial church and the Way of the Cross behind it has 15 bronze sculptures depicting the passion of Jesus being captured by Roman soldiers, crucified, suffering, passing away, and being interred.\n<br><br>\nKim Daegeon (1822~1846) <br>\nKorea’s first Catholic priest and saint.

The temple was built by King Jeongjo to protect Hyeollyungwon (현륭원), the tomb of his father, Crown Prince Sado.  <br><br>\nThis site was originally the location of Garyangsa Temple, which was constructed in 854 AD, the 16th year of King Munseong of the Silla Kingdom. The temple was very famous as it was surrounded by beautiful mountains and crystal clear waters.  However, the temple was destroyed by fire during the Byungjahoran (the second Manchu invasion of Korea). \nDuring the Joseon Dynasty, King Jeongjo moved the tomb of his father, Crown Prince Sado (or posthumously designated King Jangjo), to this spot, and built Yongjusa Temple here to pray for the repose of his father’s soul.  \n It is said that one night before the temple was completed, King Jeongjo dreampt of a dragon ascending to the sky holding a magic ball in its mouth. He therefore named the temple “Yongjusa”, which means the temple of a dragon with a magic ball in Korean. \n<br><br>\nThe courtyard of the temple contains Beomjong (the Sacred Bell of Yongjusa Temple, National Treasure No. 120), a stone pagoda, Daeungbojeon (the main hall) and Cheonboru Pavilion. Visitors to Yongjusa Temple can also find the “Bumoeunjunggyeong (부모은중경)” books, which were written by King Jeongjo on the subject of filial affection and respect for one’s parents. \nThese days Yongjusa temple and the Yungneung and Geolleung tombs are highly valued for their cultural heritage.",

   "info": "<br>Hongyureung (홍유릉) refers to the two royal tombs, Hongneung and Yureung, which are both located in the same area. Hongneung is the mausoleum of the 26th ruler of the Joseon Dynasty, Emperor Gojong (1852-1919, reign 1863-1907), and his wife Empress Myeongseong (1851-1895). <br><br>\n<b>Hongneung(홍릉)</b> was first the tomb of Empress Myeongseong, and it was located in Cheongnyangni, Seoul. When Emperor Gojong died, he was buried together with the previously deceased empress and the tomb was moved to its current place. <br><br>\nEmperor Gojong was the second son of the regent Heungseon Daewongun and ascended to the throne at the young age of twelve. In 1897, he declared Korea to be the “Daehan Empire” and established himself as the emperor. However, under unrelenting pressure from Japan, he signed the Eulsa Treaty, and as a result, the Daehan Empire was deprived of its diplomatic rights. In 1919, Emperor Gojong died in Deoksugung Palace at the age of 67.  <br><Br>\nEmpress Myeongseong became the empress in 1866. However, at that time, Korea was actually governed not by Emperor Gojong, but by his father, who was controlling things from behind the scenes. In 1873, when Emperor Gojong began to administer state affairs, Empress Myeongseong exercised considerable power and deeply participated in political affairs. Her diplomatic policy was in obvious favor of Russia. This angered Japan, and she was killed by Japanese assassins.  <br><br>\n<b>Yureung (유릉)</b> is both the last royal tomb of the Joseon Dynasty and the tomb of the first Korean emperor. It is the tomb of Emperor Sunjong (1874-1926, reign 1907-1910), the 27th ruler of the Joseon Dynasty, his first wife Empress Sunmyeonghyo, and his second wife, Empress Sunjeonghyo.\nEmperor Sunjong was the second son of Emperor Gojong and Empress Myeongseong. He was the last ruler of the Joseon Dynasty, and he struggled to defend the dynasty during that era of turbulence. \n<br><br>\nEmpress Sunmyeonghyo died when she was still the crown princess. She was originally buried at the foot of Mt. Yongmasan. After Emperor Sunjong died, the tomb was moved to its current location, and the emperor was buried alongside Empress Sunmyeonghyo. \nEmpress Sunjeonghyo became the second wife of Emperor Sunjong at the age of twelve. It is known that she concealed the Imperial Seal when Japan put pressure on the Joseon Dynasty to sign the Korea (Joseon) -Japan Consolidation Treaty in 1910. However, the treaty was concluded, and the Daehan Empire came to an end after being deprived of its sovereignty. Empress Sunjeonghyo is said to have maintained her dignity right up until the moment she died. She was the last empress of the Daehan Empire. \n<br><br>\nHongneung and Yureung look different from other royal tombs. When the name of the country changed from the Joseon Dynasty to the Daehan Empire, the rulers of Korea were called emperors. Therefore, the tombs of the two emperors were modeled after the tomb of the Ming Dynasty’s ruler, King Taizu (Zhu Yuanzhang). Surrounding Hongneung and Yureung are statues carved in the shape of animals such as giraffes, elephants, and lions, which can’t be seen at the other royal tombs of the Joseon Dynasty. The stonework of Hongneung tomb was made in a traditional way, while the stonework of Yureung tomb shows a more realistic and advanced technique.<br><br>",

The fortress, constructed from 1794 to 1796, was built as a display of King Jeongjo’s filial piety towards his father and to build a new pioneer city with its own economic power.\n<br><br>\nThe fortress wall stretches for a total of 5.52km and has a great variety of military facilities that are hard to find anywhere else. Four gates face each of the cardinal directions—Janganmun (north), Paldalmun (south), Changnyongmun (east), and Hwaseomun (west)—and the seven-arch style Sumun gates straddle the point where the nearby stream reaches the palace. Above the Sumun gates is a pavilion called Hwahongmun.  \n<br><br>\nHwaseong Fortress was constructed under the guidance of Yu Hyeong-Won (1622-1673) and Jeong Yak-Yong (1762-1836), and is believed to have been constructed very scientifically. The fortress wall was built using Seokjae and Jeondol (bricks) and the holes between the bricks are just big enough to fire guns, arrows, or long spears through in case of an attack. \n<br><br>\nDuring construction of the fortress Jeong Yak-Yong invented ‘Geojunggi,’ which uses a ‘hwalcha’ (lever) to lift up heavy stones, greatly reducing construction time.  \n<br><br>\nThe Suwon Hwaseong Fortress went through many turbulent times and damage, and in the battle of June 25th, many of the facilities became so damaged that they were deemed irreparable. Even though the fortress restoration initiative (1975-1979) restored many of the sites to their former glory, Paldalmun to Dongnamgakru (an area 491 meters in length) has still not been renovated.  \n<br><br>\nThe fortress was designated as Historic Site No. 3 in January 1963, and in December 1997, it was designated a UNESCO World Cultural Heritage Site. A variety of performances and events are held at the fortress every day and Suwon Hwaseong Cultural Festival takes place here in autumn.",

   "info": "Yungneung (융릉) is the joint tomb of King Jangjo (1735-1762) and Queen Heongyeong (1735-1815). King Jangjo was the father of King Jeongjo, the 22nd ruler of the Joseon Dynasty. <br>\n<br>\n King Jangjo was the second son of King Yeongjo, the 21st ruler of the Joseon Dynasty. He was installed as a Crown Prince in 1736. As the Crown Prince, he administered the state affairs on behalf of his father and showed great capability in various fields. However, he died in 1762 after being locked in a wooden rice chest&nbsp;by the orders of his father, King Yeongjo. <br>\n <br>\n The tomb of this ill-fated Crown Prince was originally located in Baebongsan Mountain located in Yangju-gun, Gyeonggi-do. His son, King Jeongjo moved the tomb to  Hwasan Mountain in Hwaseong, Gyeonggi-do and changed the title of the tomb to Hyeollyungwon (현륭원). Later, he posthumously gave his father the title King Jangjo and moved the tomb to its current place, and the title of the tomb was changed again to Yungneung.<br>\n<br>\n Queen Heongyeong was designated as a Crown princess in 1744. In 1795 when she turned 60 and long after her husband died, she wrote Hanjungnok (한중록), the memoirs, which is mainly about the terrible fate of her husband.<br>\n The Memoirs have great historical significance, and these along with the Tales of Queen Inhyeon (Inhyeon Wanghujeon, 인현왕후전), are highly valued as pieces of royal literature.<br>\n<br>\nYungneung is currently located in Annyeong-dong in Hwaseong. A stone called &ldquo;Byeongpungseok&rdquo; surrounds the tomb. On the stone, peony and lotus flowers are engraved. Like other royal tombs, there are two separate spaces &ndash; one raised and one lower space. In the raised space, there is the mound, &ldquo;Honyuseok&rdquo;, which is a rectangular shaped stone sitting in front of the mound, and 'Mangjuseok,' which is a pair of stones that sit on both sides of the mound. In the lower spaces, there are several stone statues. They include &ldquo;Muninseok&rdquo;, a statue of a civil officer, &ldquo;Muinseok&rdquo;, a statue of a military officer, and &ldquo;Seokma&rdquo;, a statue of a horse. <br>\n<br>\n<br>\n <b>Geolleung (건릉)</b> is the joint tomb of King Jeongjo (1752-1800), the 22nd ruler of the Joseon Dynasty, and Queen Hyoui (1753-1821). <br>\n<br>\n King Jeongjo&rsquo;s last wish was to be buried near his father&rsquo;s tomb in Yungneung. King Jeongjo was the second son of King Jangjo and Queen Heongyeong, but in 1759, when he was 8 years old, he was designated as an heir to the throne. During his 24 year-reign, King Jeongjo influenced state affairs by implementing the &ldquo;Tangpyeongchaek&rdquo; (탕평책, a policy to balance the power of political factions), and he also had great accomplishments in the area of academic research by creating the &ldquo;Gyujanggak&rdquo; (규장각, a national royal library). <br>\n<br>\n Queen Hyoui was a daughter of Kim Si Muk and was installed as a partner of the heir to the throne at the age of 10. In 1776, when King Jeongjo ascended the throne, she also became Queen. She is known to have led a frugal life. In 1821, she died without an heir at the age of 69 in Jagyeongjeon, Changgyeonggung Palace. <br>\n<br> Geolleung looks very similar to Yungneung, but unlike Yungneung, it does not have a &ldquo;Byeongpungseok&rdquo;, which is a wide and rectangular stone that surrounds the mound and protects it. Instead, it is surrounded by &ldquo;Nanganseok&rdquo;, stone handrails. On every handrail, lotus flowers are engraved. King Jeongjo&rsquo;s tomb is simpler and less decorated than his father&rsquo;s, which reflects King Jeongjo&rsquo;s respect and love for his father. Both Geolleung and Yungneung are designated as Historic Site No. 206.",

On the night of his brief stopover, Monk Wonhyo was awoken from his sleep by a powerful thirst. Luckily, he found a bowl full of water and drank it before falling back to sleep. The next morning, he was very surprised to discover that the bowl he had drunk from was in fact an old skull. Out of this shock grew the realization that truth can only be found in one’s mind and not through any outside circumstance. In light of this new awakening, the Great Monk Wonhyo decided not to go to Tang, but rather to stay and continue his search for true salvation while delivering Buddha’s teachings to the masses. <br><br>\n\nDuring his ministry, Monk Wonhyo preached Buddha’s teachings through the use of everyday food, emphasizing the idea that healthy food cleanses the body and enriches the soul, leading to true salvation. Under these same principles, Sudosa Temple now operates traditional temple food and temple experience programs that allow visitors to gain a deeper understanding of Monk Wonhyo’s beliefs. <br><br>\n\n\nPrograms currently available include: Temple Etiquette Learning Buddhist Service, 108 Prostration (repenting 108 times), Barugongyang (monk’s table manner), Tea & Dining Etiquette, Making Lotus Lamps, Walking Barefoot among the Pines, Feet Cleansing Ceremony, Listening to Meditation Music, Contemplating Buddhist Scripture, and Cultivating Kitchen Gardens. At the temple, visitors can also learn how to cook Korea’s traditional temple food, which is one of the major pillars of Buddhist culture. <br><br>\n\n\n* Sudosa Temple proudly practices the concept of LOHAS (Lifestyle of Health and Sustainability) and has officially been recognized as a ‘Slow Food Best Practice Town.’",

This was the first joint royal tomb of the Joseon Dynasty.<br><br>\nKing Sejong was the third son of the 3rd ruler, King Taejong, and his wife Queen Wongyeong. He came to the throne at the age of 22. During his 32-year reign, he was very influential in the development of Korean culture. For example, King Sejong created the Korean alphabet, which he called Hunmin Jeongeum, and set up the Hall of Worthies (Jiphyeonjeon, 집현전), an association of the kingdom’s brightest scholars. He also used Confucian principles to administer state affairs. Under the reign of King Sejong, therefore, many sectors including politics, economy, society and culture flourished. In fact, King Sejong the Great is regarded as making some of the most brilliant achievements in Korean history.   <br><br>\nYeongneung is currently located in Neungseo-myeon in Yeoju-si in Gyeonggi-do, but the tomb was originally located in Seogang, Gwangju. When it was constructed following Queen Soheon’s death in 1446, it was decided it should be a double tomb, and the space on the right side was reserved for King Sejong. In 1450 when King Sejong died, he was buried together with the dead queen. Later, the tomb was moved to its current place, as it was thought that the original location was not an auspicious place according to geomantic traditions.<br><br>\nVarious items that were originally buried in the tomb were excavated in 1973 and now are exhibited in the King Sejong the Great Memorial Hall (세종대왕 기념관), which is located in Cheongnyangni, Seoul. <br><br>\n<b>Nyeongneung (녕릉/영릉)</b> is the royal tomb of the 17th ruler of the Joseon Dynasty, King Hyojong (1619-1659, reign 1649-1659), and of his wife Queen Inseon (1618-1674).<br><br>\nThe tomb was originally located to the west of Geonwolleung (건원릉, the tomb of King Taejo, the 1st ruler of the Joseon Dynasty), but in 1673 cracks appeared on the tomb’s “Byeongpungseok” (stone border), and it was moved to its current location, which is to the east of Yeongneung (영릉, the tomb of King Sejong).<br><br>\nKing Hyojong was the second son of King Injo, Joseon Dynasty’s 16th ruler, and Queen Illyeol. Upon ascending to the throne, he devised a plan to conquer the Northern region of Asia, including the Qing Dynasty (part of China). As part of the plan, he reformed the military system and strengthened the army and military enforcements. King Hyojong had spent time in northern China when he was taken hostage by the Manchus. During that time he became exposed to many different cultures and technological advancements. When a group of Dutch sailors were shipwrecked on the Korean shore, King Hyojong ordered them to build the Korean army’s first muskets. <br><br>\nKing Hyojong also implemented “Daedongbeop (대동법)”, a tax system under which people had to pay taxes with rice, and circulated “Sangpyeongtongbo (상평통보)”, the coinage of the Joseon Dynasty.",

Located In the vicinity of Peace Dam is Bimok Park, which is the origin of the famous national song “Bimok.”\n<br><br>\nIn addition to the war monuments inside the park, there are around a dozen wooden crosses with rusty iron helmets placed on top within the barbed wire entanglements around the hill, thereby reminding visitors of the national tragedy of the Korean War. The county of Hwancheon hosts the Bimok Cultural Festival from June 3 to June 6 every year at Bimok Park, Bungeoseom Island by the town’s riverside, and the surrounding areas. The four-day festival offers a variety of events such as song contest, memorial ceremony of poetry reading, bimok tree cutting contest, rice ball eating contest, army life experience, military music parade, and more. \n<br><br>\nCrossing over to Yanggu County from Peace Dam, there is a national security education place comprised of attractions like the 4th Underground Tunnel and Eulji Observatory. Paroho Lake Battlefield Tourist Park is also worth a visit after looking around Peace Dam. Also known as the “ocean within mountains,” Paroho is a manmade lake created as a result of Hwacheon Dam constructed in 1944. The lake is home to over 70 different species of freshwater fish such as mandarin fish and carp. It also holds a sorrowful history of burying at sea a whole three divisions of the Chinese Forces in defending the lake during the Korean War. The name Paroho, meaning “enemy breaking lake,” was given after the late president of Korea Rhee Syngman visited the place and designated a plaque in his own handwriting in memory of obtaining victory in fierce battle. There is an observatory, a security hall, and a stone monument engraved with the poetry of Wolha Rhee Taegeuk (1913-2003).",

However, the cave was found to have natural stalactites, and was later developed into the only theme-based cave that combined gold and nature. The stalactite area is an open space of 2,800㎡ and the length of the path open to visitors is 1,803 meters. The entire area consists of 5 sections which in turn constitute 41 zones; it takes about an hour and a half to see all of the zones. You can travel to the entrance of Hwaamdonggul Cave on Korea’s first cave monorail listening to the soft piped-in music of Jeongseon Arirang.

Jumchi hanji is light but has a strong enough surface to be arrow-proof, and therefore it was often used for armory or winter outfits.

The mountain remains this way because villagers burned the fields once a year to encourage the growth of wild herbs.<br><br>\n\nThe mountain’s gradual slope offers an enjoyable trekking experience for hikers of all levels. In mid-October, waist-high silver grass is indeed everywhere, making it challenging for hikers to view the surrounding areas. Fortunately, certain spots near the peak offer breathtaking views of the gentle ridges and flowing hillsides.<br><br>\n\nSilver grass begins blooming in September and reaches peak colors between October and November. The Silver Grass Festival is held on Mindungsan Mountain every October, attracting hundreds of thousands of attendees for a wonderful outdoor hiking experience and picturesque photo opportunities. The mountain is easily accessible by train allowing visitors from near and far to enjoy the fall colors.<br><br>\n\nOn the outskirts of Mindungsan Mountain near Balgudeok village is Goebyeonggol Valley, which contains magnificent rock formations and limestone caves.

However, it is now known that the temple was built after King Sukjong, the 19th King of Joseon Dynasty (1392~1910), who reigned from 1674 to 1720, because of the architectural style of the Daewoongjeon Shrine. There is a legend that the Guryongsa Temple site was originally a lake where nine dragons lived.  The name Guryong comes from the story that the lake was filled up to build the temple on it. There are many shrines such as Daewoongjeon, Bogwangnu, Samseonggak, Simgeomdang and Seolseondang.  Daewoongjeon has maintained its original shape though it was repaired many times. Daewoongjeon is a wooden building with the basic Dapojip style in the Joseon Era.

Hwajinpo Lake is surrounded by evergreens and white sandy beaches; it is a lagoon where the river and the sea meet.  Materials drifting down the river deposited at the bottom of the river become a sandy beach that eventually block off the river from the sea, creating a lagoon. Hwajinpo Lake is the largest lagoon near the East Sea, and has many ancient artifacts around it, such as the Ten Goindol rocks (also called Jiseokmyeo) scattered around the lake. Because of its excellent scenery, Kim Il-seong (1912-1994) of North Korea and the South Korean president Rhee Syngman (1875-1965) had summer houses here after the independence of Korea in 1945. The two houses that originally faced each other with the lake at the center are gone now, but the sites still remain as tourist destinations.

The following legend still lives through to this day; among the three rocks, the big rock is called Nampyeonbong, Janggunbong the rock on the right side is called Cheobong (or Adeulbong), and the rock on the left is called Cheopbong (or Ddalbong). According to the legend there lived a couple who loved each other, but had no child.  They found a mistress because they wanted to have a baby, but once she had the baby, she began to mistreat and taunt the wife. The heavens saw them, and turned all of them into stones. The way the rocks stand next to one another is very interesting. \n<br>\n<br>If you go to the opposite side of Dodamsambong, there is a small pavilion called lhoyangjeong. It was built to comfort the locals who lost their homes due to the flooding caused by Chungju Dam. When you look down from the pavilion, you can take in the entire Dodamsambong at once.
