It was the principal palace for many kings  of the Joseon Dynasty, and is the most well-preserved of the five remaining royal Joseon palaces. The palace grounds are comprised of a public palace area, a royal family residence building, and the rear garden. Known as a place of rest for the kings, the rear garden boasts a gigantic tree that is over 300 years old, a small pond and a pavilion. <br>\n<br>\n The palace gained importance starting from the time of Seongjong, the 9th king of Joseon, when a number of kings began using it as a place of residence. Unfortunately, the palace was burned down by angry citizens in 1592 when the royal family fled their abode during the Japanese invasion of Korea. Thanks to Gwanghaegun, the palace was restored in 1611. Even today, it houses a number of cultural treasures, such as Injeongjeon Hall, Daejojeon Hall, Seonjeongjeon Hall, and Nakseonjae. <br>\n<br>\n Changdeokgung Palace’s rear garden was constructed during the reign of King Taejong and served as a resting place for the royal family members. The garden had formerly been called Bukwon and Geumwon, but was renamed Biwon after King Kojong came into power. The garden was kept as natural as possible and was touched by human hands only when absolutely necessary. Buyongjeong, Buyongji, Juhabru, Eosumun, Yeonghwadang, Bullomun, Aeryeonjeong, and Yeongyeongdang are some of the many pavilions and fountains that occupy the garden.

   "info": "One of the amazing things about Seoul is that some of the most interesting historical sites are right in the middle of the business districts. Located near the Jongno Police Station and the Japanese Cultural Center, Unhyeongung Royal  Residence is one such site. <br>\n<br>\nUnhyeongung Royal  Residence was the home of young Gojong, who later became Emperor during the Joseon Dynasty. Under order of Queen Mother Jo, Unhyeongung was renovated into a grand, palace-like house with four gates. Gojong’s father, Yi Haeung, or better known as Heungseon Daewongun, continued to live at Unhyeongung for most of his life. Damaged during the Japanese colonial period and the Korean War, the Unhyeongung  Royal Residence seen today is a much smaller version of the majestic structure that it used to be. <br>\n<br>\nEntering through  the front gate, the first noticeable sight is a small row of rooms to the right. This area, called Sujiksa, housed the servants and guards. To the front, left-hand side of Sujiksa is a structure called Norakdang. Many important events, such as birthday parties and ceremonies, as well as the wedding ceremony for Gojong and Myeongseong, were held here. To this day, traditional wedding ceremonies continue to be held at Norakdang. <br>\n<br>\nNorakdang also served as one of the two women’s quarters. The most notable structure inside Norakdang is the kitchen, which was used for food preparation when hosting important events. Right outside Norakdang, there are several rock structures along the path to Irodang. The rock structures are said to resemble various animals. To the left of Norakdang lies Irodang, the main building of Unhyeongung. This was where the wife of Heungseon Daewongun resided. Irodang's most prominent feature is its tall steps and square shape. It was built this way in order to help protect the women inside from intruders. Outside Irodang lays an old well on one side of the wide, open yard. To the right of Norakdang lies Noandang.<br>\n <br>\nNoandang served as the men’s quarters and was where Heungseon Daewongun received his guests. The word <i>noan</i> means \"old man\" and carries with it the connotation of comfort and  ease. Thus, it served as the leisure quarters for the men. However, Noandang was not just a place of rest and entertainment. As the father of a young Emperor, Heungseon Daewongun carried out all his business from Noandang.<br>\n<br>\n Upon exiting Noandang, there lies an Exhibition Hall to the far right.

The hiking course is also connected to the road in front of Cheongwadae so hikers can also walk along the historical Palpan-ro road, Hyoja-ro road, and Gyeongbokgung Palace. The hiking path located behind Sajik Park leads to Hwanghakjeong Pavilion, where archers during the Joseon Dynasty once honed their marksmanship. The Hwanghakjeong Pavilion was originally located in the Gyeongbokgung Palace but was relocated to the mountain. From the top, a panoramic view of the surrounding area spreads as far as Naksan Mountain, Namsan Mountain, and Baegaksan Mountain with Gyeongbokgung Palace at its center. \n<br><br>\nThe hiking path past Sajik Park's T-intersection is a popular walking course to nearby office workers during lunch time. A view of Cheongwadae is visible from a top <em>beombawi</em> rock (tiger's rock). For hikers seeking to walk along the ridges, it is recommended to take the path down to Hongje-dong quarry or Jahamun Gate. Hikers are recommended to take their time to fully enjoy the view of the surroundings while walking along the path of the outer walls. The stone stairway following the path past Changuimun Gate will take hikers to the path along the outer walls. This path stretches for approximately 200m and a set of stones used to build the city walls during the reign of King Taejo, King Sejong, and King Sukjung still remain along the way. The thick, dark-colored mosses on the stones indicate the long history of Seoul.<br><br>\n\nThe view of the refreshing landscape and Inwangsan Mountain's peak will greet the hikers once they walk back to the inner city walls through a step of stones. Hikers will be able to get a bird's-eye-view of Seoul's mountains and skyscrapers surrounding the Hangang River. The city walls along the path going down to Cheongun-dong still withhold their beauty from the past. \n\nThe inner wall path also leads to the Tangchundaeseong Fortress. Tanchundaeseong Fortress was built in order to reinforce the capital’s defenses after the Japanese invasion in 1592 and the Manchu war of 1636. \n<br><br>\nInwangsan Mountain stands at a x_height of 338.2m and spreads throughout the regions of Hongje-dong in Seodaemun-gu and Muak-dong, Nusang-dong, Ogin-dong and Buam-dong in Jongno-gu.

   "info": "Located at the corner of Seoul's busiest downtown intersection, Deoksugung Palace is famous for its elegant stone-wall road.  It is also the only palace that sits alongside a series of western style buildings that add to the uniqueness of the surrounding scenery.  Deoksugung Palace originally belonged to Wolsandaegun (1454-1488), the older brother of King Seongjong (1469-1494) of the Joseon Dynasty.  It became a proper palace when Gwanghaegun (1575-1641) ascended to the throne and gave this royal residence the name Gyeongungung Palace in 1611. Over the following decades, the palace alternated between being an official palace and a temporary residence. The name did not official change to Deoksugung Palace, meaning the “palace of virtuous longevity,” until 1907. While the palace incompassed a vast area with many buildings, the current palace grounds are just a small shadow of the prior splendor, with very few structures remaining.<br><br>\n\nUpon entering Deoksugung Palace through Daehanmun Gate, visitors will cross the wide bridge of Geumcheon Stream. The king's carriage would pass over this bridge during ancient times. The legal building Junghwajeon Hall is very stately, revealing its long history. The Jeukjodang Building received its name from Gwanghaegun and In-Jo,  who both ascended to the throne here.  The front sign on Jeukjodang was written personally by Gojong (26th king of the Joseon Dynasty, r. 1863-1907) in 1905 after he became king.  Hamnyeongjeon Hall was where Gojong slept, named with the meaning of wishing for lasting peace for Gojong.  The East Wing served as the king’s room, and the west wing was for the queen.<br><br>\n\nJeonggwanheon Hall was the first Western-style building built in the palace,  completed in 1900.  Gojong enjoyed drinking coffee and spending his free time here. The back of the building had secret passageways to the Russian Emissary, which still exist today. Seokjojeon Hall is the other Western-style building that still remains in Deoksugung Palace, and it was in the process of being built by a British man for his company, when in 1905 the property rights were transferred to Japan.  It was finally completed in 1910.  After Gojong’s death, Seokjojeon Hall became a Japanese art gallery open to the public. After the Korean Declaration of Independence, the American-Russian joint commission was held here as well in May 1946.  The east wing of Seokjogwan Hall now serves as a palace treasure exhibition, and the west wing is used as part of the  National Modern Art Center.<br><br>\n\n Junghwajeon Hall was the center of politics during the Korean Empire and served as the backdrop to critical discussions on national affairs among the country’s leaders. The elaborateness of the hall’s interior is said to reflect the confidence of King Gojong in his ability to effectively lead the country into the 20th century. One of the most striking parts of the building is the pair of dragons that decorates the canopy above the throne of the king. These dragons can also  be seen on the ceiling of Junghwajeon Hall and were representative designs of Deoksugung Palace, the imperial palace at that time. Though Junghwajeon Hall was originally built in 1902 as a multi-roofed  building, it was redesigned as a single-roofed building in 1906 after it caught on fire two years before that.",

It often served as residential quarters for queens and concubines. During the reign of King Seongjong (r.1469-1494), the palace was renovated and renamed to Changgyeonggung Palace. It later became a park with a zoo and a botanical garden during Japanese colonial rule. The palace grounds remained this way until 1983 when restoration of its old grace was completed.\n<br>\n<br>Past the main entrance of Changgyeonggung Palace, Honghwa Gate, you will find Okcheongyo Bridge.  All palaces of the Joseon dynasty have ponds with an arch bridge over them, just like Okcheongyo Bridge.  Cross Okcheongyo Bridge, pass the Myeongjeongmun Gate, and you will find Myeonjeongjeon.  This is the office of the king, and Myeongjeongjeon is the oldest of the Joseon Dynasty palaces.  The houses face southwards, but Myeongjeongjeon faces east. Because the ancestral shrine of the royal family is located to the south, \nthe gate couldn't face the south, as is required by Confucian custom. There are stones with the status of the officials carved on the yard.  Behind Myeongjeongjeon on the upper left side  is Sungmundang.  This building utilizes the slope of the mountain.  If you look at Myeongjeongjeon and Munjeongjeon, the combination of the high and low roofs offers a beautiful view.\n<br>\n<br>Tongmyeongjeon was built for the queen.  It is the biggest building in Changgyeonggung Palace, and you can recognize the delicate details of its structure in various parts of the building.  Walk up the stones past Tongmyeongjeon and there you will find Jagyeongjeon.  On the southeast direction of the Jagyeongjeon is the Punggidae.  This Punggidae is a measuring instrument.  It is a long pole with a cloth hung at the end used to check the speed and direction of the wind.  If you head north there is a large pond called Chundangji.  Half of the pond was originally a rice field that the king took care of.  But during the Japanese occupation, the rice field was changed to a pond with little ships floating on it.  And the botanic garden built above the pond still remains today.<br><br>",

However, this tomb was not well-maintained compared to other royal tombs because of a power struggle. The queen consort had many children, which naturally induced a battle for the throne. Usually the son of the first wife is the successor of the throne, but Queen Consort Sindeok was determined to have one of her sons ascend the throne instead.  However, the successor, King Taejong, killed all her sons and developed an extreme abhorrence towards the queen consort.  When she died, King Taejong issued an order to not maintain and preserve her tomb.  Therefore, the tomb is rather unkempt and the layout and composition is different from other royal tombs.\n<br>\nUpon entering the red gate, the sacrificial building can be seen in front of the tomb along with a pavilion and tombstone.  Stone sculptures of sheep and tigers watch over the tomb.  A major difference between this tomb and other royal tombs is exhibited in the path from the red gate to the sacrificial building.  Usually the path is a straight line, but at Jeongneung Royal Tomb, it is crooked and bent.  Furthermore, the color of the sacrificial building is dull and faded.\n<br>\nEven though the tomb symbolizes the turmoil and wrath of political struggles, many couples and families come to Jeongneung Royal Tomb for a stroll because of its peacefulness and natural surroundings.",

The name Bukhansan means \"big mountain in the north,\" and it is also called Samgaksan Mountain. Bukhansan Mountain has such smooth curves that the large granite rocks sometimes look as if they would slide down the mountain. The sharp peaks provide contrast to the dozens of valleys and rivers flowing below. The mountain has many different kinds of peaks but its main peak is Baegunbong. The granite peaks blend well with trees, and there are about 1,300 kinds of animals and plants living on the mountain. Among the granite peaks, the best known is Insubong Peak's Giam rocks. The world famous granite rock peak Insubong is over 200m above sea level, and there are about 100 mountain paths leading to the rock. When you stand on Baegundae and look down, sometimes you can see as far as Seoul City and the Hangang River.  \n<br><Br>\nBukhansan Mountain has a rich history as well. Silla's King Jinheung Sunsubi Monument on Bibong Peak, the Bukhansanseong Fortress built along the mountain's ridges, Sangunsa Temple built by the monk Won-Hyo, and numerous other temples occupy the mountain areas. Especially, Bukhansanseong Fortress is a must-see tour site if you are visiting the mountain. The fortress was built with a wall spanning about 8,500m, built specifically to stop foreign invasion. It is one of the representative mountain fortresses of the Joseon Era. In the fall, the view you can get from the fortress of the mountain is spectacular. Temples are also representative of rich culture that flourished on Bukhansan. The Seungasa Temple on the east Bibong Peak, with <i>Maaeseokgayeoraejwasang</i> \n (seated rock-carved Buddhas) carved into a 5m granite rock, and the Munsusa Temple located halfway up the Musubong Peak, with purified mountain water dropping from the ceiling of Munsugol Cave, are indicative of both Bukhansan's history and culture. <br><br>With its granite peaks and Bukhansanseong Fortress, Bukhansan is perfect for hiking in all seasons. In the spring, all kinds of flowers bloom, and in the summer, lush forests carpet the numerous valleys.

After visiting the site, Doseonguksa made a prophecy that led to the construction of the temple. According to legend, he used only his walking stick to carve the large Bodhisattva that sits at the temple. Interestingly enough, the statue does not show any evidence of chisel marks, further adding to the mystery of how the statue was made.  \n<br><br>\nDuring the 7th year of King Gwangmu of the Joseon Dynasty, Doseonsa Temple was officially named the representative temple of Korea with the purpose of promoting Cheongdamdaejongsa's Korean Buddhism movement, aiming at a religious revival. Due to these special circumstances Deseonsa Temple gained a high reputation and much recognition, which have held strong to this day.\n<br><br>\nInside the temple, visitors can view the remains and written works of Cheongdamdaejongsa in the Cheongdamdaejongsa Memorial Hall. Next to the road leading to Cheonbuljeon Hall is a pond where you can toss a coin and make a wish and just past Yongammun Gate is a hiking path connecting Baegundae Cliff and Insubong Peak. Inside the Ksitigarbha Hall are portraits of President Park Chung-hee, Yuk Yeong-su, and Hyundai Chairman Chung Ju-yung. In front of the hall is a tree that is said to have been planted by a Buddhist priest who brought it from India 200 years ago. Historical artifacts can be found throughout the temple.",

The legacy of the 1988 Seoul Olympics, the park not only houses the country’s largest sports arena, but has also become a place where Seoul residents come to relax and unwind. \n<br><br>\nSpread across 430,000 pyeong (approximately 1.45 million ㎡), Olympic Park encompasses the land that was once Mongchontoseong Fortress and Mongchonhaeja (manmade lake) from the early Baekje period. The park is divided into several zones, including a leisure sports park, a cultural art park, an eco-park, and the History Experience Park dedicated to the area’s rich historic heritage. \n<br><br>\nBecause Olympic Park is so large and takes over three hours to explore, visitors are advised to familiarize themselves with entrances and exits and travel routes before they start. To further save time, visitors can ride the Road Train (“Hodori Train”) located next to Peace Square. \n<br><br>\n* Cultural Art Park<br>\nThe Cultural Art Park is a place where visitors can enjoy diverse cultural experiences and performances. The park also features Olympic Museum, Seoul Olympics Museum of Art (SOMA)—one of the world’s top five sculpture museums—and Music Fountain. \n<br><br>\n* Leisure Sports Park<br>\nThis area is comprised of Sports Square (walking/jogging paths, an acupressure path, inline skating area, etc.) and Peace Square (a pleasant area with a wide variety of activities and sports lessons). \n<br><br>\n* Environmental Eco-Park<br>\nPersistent efforts have succeeded in restoring natural splendor to this place where a equally splendid civilization once blossomed. People and nature co-exist comfortably within Environmental Eco-Park, which has become home to families of spot-billed ducks, white herons, cuckoos, pheasants, Korean squirrels, chipmunks, and frogs. More recent efforts to rejuvenate the local ecosystem have resulted in the appearance of woodpeckers and raccoons, both of which are rarely spotted in cities. The croaking of small round frogs can now be heard within the park as well. \n<br><br>\n* History Experience Park \nVisitors to the park can experience Korean history firsthand at Mongchontoseong Fortress and Baekje Museum, while hearkening back to the more recent, grand spirit of the Olympics in the \"Holy Land of Peace.\"",

Gwanghwamun Gate consists of three arched gates; the center gate was used by the king, while the other two were used by the crown prince and royal officials. The tall granite walls of the gate serve as a platform for the wooden gate tower that watches over the city. The gate has a sign with its name written at the top center of the gate tower. <br>\n<br> Gwanghwamun Gate went through several damages and restorations over the course of history. It was first severely damaged during the Imjin War (1592-1598) and was not restored until the reconstruction of Gyeongbokgung Palace in 1864. Under the Japanese administration, the gate was demolished and relocated to the north of the palace's eastern gate, followed by series of damages during the Korean War (1950-1953). In 1968, Gwanghwamun Gate was relocated back to the south of the palace and was rebuilt using concrete; however, the gate’s position was shifted a few meters away from its original location. In 2006, a major reconstruction project took place to restore Gwanghwamun Gate to its original state and location, disassembling the structure completely and replacing concrete with granite and wood. After three years and eight months of construction, Gwanghwamun Gate was fully restored to its original form and was open to the public on August 15, 2010.",

Nevertheless, reconstruction efforts were started in 1711 (37th year of King Sukjong) and the water channel gate was restored and a gate tower built. Gwanghuimun Gate remained intact even when the fortress walls were demolished to build tram tracks during the Japanese occupation, but it was damaged during the Korean War and left neglected. In 1975, restoration work was carried out to relocate Gwanghuimun Gate to a site 15 meters south of its original location since it stood in the middle of the road.",

Beyond the red gate is a sacrificial building where the memorial rites were performed.  Behind the sacrificial building is the royal tomb.  On the eaves of the sacrificial building are stone sculptures called japsang, which are carved into the shapes of animals such as monkeys and are believed to exorcise evil spirits.  There is a pavilion next to the sacrificial building where the tombstone is located.  The tombstone indicates who lies in the mound.  The stone figures guarding the king’s tomb are memorable.  A sacrificial building called \"jasil\" is now used as maintenance office and is worth visiting.  The eaves, latticework and wooden floor are so well preserved that visitors can truly get an authentic feeling when walking through the premises.  \n<br>\nYeonghwiwon & Sunginwon boast splendid views in the fall when the leaves change colour.

The legend has it that a young scholar on Hwanghae-do Province (now North Korea) fell in love with the daughter of a district magistrate. The magistrate, disapproving the relationship, exiled his daughter to a faraway island in an effort to dissolve the relationship. Saddened by the mysterious disappearance of his lover, the young scholar spent many nights wondering of her whereabouts. One night, whilst sleeping the young scholar dreamed of a white crane that revealed to him the location of his lover. He found her on the distant island now called Baengnyeongdo. On hearing this story, the local people of the area started calling the island Baekhakdo which means, “the white crane told him so.\" Then, in 1018 AD, the name changed again to  Baengnyeongdo, with ‘baeg’ meaning white crane and ‘nyeong’ meaning wings.<br><br>\nDuring the Korean War, the island was a base for a famous guerilla fighting group against the communist North. Known as the White Tigers, the group made numerous incursions from the islands in the vicinity into North Korea. After the War, the remaining fighters were known to have taken refuge on neighboring Daecheongdo Island.",

It was said that he was exiled on Daecheongdo for meddling in a plot arranged by his stepmother. He supposedly arrived on the island with 100 relatives, and built a palace here. The next known record relates to the island's abundance in medicinal herbs including mulberry mistletoe (Loranthi Ramulus), which was used to cure the illness of Queen Munjeong (d.1565), the wife of King Jungjong (d.1544). There is no record of island inhabitation until 1793, when King Jeongjo, the 22nd king of the Joseon Dynasty (1392-1897), authorized the inhabitation and cultivation of the island. During the Japanese occupation of Korea (1910-1945), there were as many as 10,000 people living on the island due to its popularity as a major port.

The story of Dangun reads that he made sacrifices over 4,000 years ago, making this relic a historical treasure. \n<br>\nChamseongdan was renovated in 1270 under Goryeo Wonjong’s and after being renovated several more times. To this day it has remained the same way and kept the same appearance. Chamseongdan is a natural stone 5 meters in x_height, circular in shape at the bottom and rectangular at the top. Because it is in the middle of Baekdusan Mountain and Hallasan Mountain, you can see the islands of the West sea and the inland scenery. It is symbolically a very important place. It is said that in the past, the kings of Goguryeo, Baekje, and Silla Kingdoms all offered sacrifices to the heavens here.  This form of ceremonial sacrificing continued prevailed until the Joseon Period (1392~1910). Visitors can see from scattered relics how Korea’s ancestors revered and feared the heavens.  Even now, on Gaecheonjeol Day, Koreans offer sacrifices to Dangun here, and for national athletic events, a sacred flame for the games is ignited here. \n<br>\nManisan Mountain is 495m above sea level, which makes it the highest mountain in Ganghwa. The entire area was designated as a National Tour Site in 1977.  Climb to the summit and you can see the entire Gyeonggi area. The path leading up to Chamseongdan especially has a wonderful view of the mountain and the sea, and is a favorite of the climbers.",

The mountain has three peaks in a row: Birobong Peak in the center and Dongbong (aka ‘Mitabong,’ 1,155m) and Seobong (aka ‘Samseongbong,’ 1,150m) on either side. \n<br><br>\nIn terms of administrational district, the park (30.593㎢ in size) is within Dong-gu, Daegu and has four towns along its border including Yeongcheon-si, Gyeongsan-si, and Chilgok-gun. A number of Buddhist temples including Donghwasa, a headquarters of the 9th Buddhist Parish, are located in the area.\n<br><br>\nThe park has numerous rocks and valleys and is carpeted with azaleas in the spring. In the autumn many visitors flock to the park to admire the falls leaves on the trees lining the 16.3km-long road through the park. With vibrant green leaves and a delicate snowscape in the winter, Palgongsan Mt is an attractive destination for visitors throughout the year. \n<br><br>\n[About Gatbawi]<br>\n<br> \n‘Gatbawi’ is a statue of Buddha that sits against a rocky cliff of Gwanbong Peak that rises 850m above the sea level. The name ‘Gatbawi’ comes from the fact that the Buddha has a flat rock (‘bawi’) on its head that looks like a Korean traditional hat (called a ‘gat’). The statue, designated Treasure No. 431, is one of the most sophisticated Buddha statues of the 9th Century. Legend has it that the statue grants honest prayers, so every year at sunrise on New Year’s Day people flock to the Buddha statue to make a wish for the new year and see the rising sun.",

Owen had hoped to build a memorial hospital in honor of his grandfather, but died before his plan was materialized. The plaque hanging in the hall honors both men in English and Chinese, reading, “In Memory of William L. and Clement C. Owen.”<br><br>\n\nA Western-style building with a total footage of around 1,435 meters squared (including the annex building), the monument is said to have been used as chapel and assembly room. Today, the building serves as the auditorium of the Christian College of Nursing. The white, two-story building features a lectern in one corner, with two columns of pews facing the lectern. The second floor balcony stretches along the two walls opposite the lectern.",

Known as the oldest surviving Western-style house in Gwangju, the house is an icon of modern culture and architecture in Korea. The house was built by an American missionary named Wilson in the 1920s (exact date unknown) and was the home of the Wilson family while they stayed in Korea. When the family completed their work in Korea, they sold the house for a very cheap price with the stipulation that the house continued to be used for missionary purposes. The house fell into the possession of the General Assembly of Chonnam Presbyterian Church of Korea in 1986 and now serves as the home office for the Presbyterian Church of Korea. <br><br>\n\nThe square-shaped house consists of a living room, a family room, a kitchen, and a bathroom (1F), several bedrooms (2F), and storage areas and a boiler room (B1). The fact that the entrance of the house faces east is said to be a result of the prevailing architectural culture of Korea at that time. A Netherland-style house built with 55-milimeter thick, gray bricks, the first and second stories are delineated on the exterior with an eye-catching band of bricks.",

The location of the confucian academy was moved to its current site in 1646 (the 24th year of King Injo) and the name 'Wolbong' was made by King Hyojong in 1654. In 1671, Bak Sang and Bak Sun's shrines were placed from Deoksansa Shrine by suggestions of Song Siyeol. Also, Kim Jangsaeng and Kim Jip's shrines were additionally placed in 1673. Unfortunately, the confucian academy was abolished due to the abolition policy of Daewongun in 1868 (the 5th year of King Gojong). Later, Bingwoldang Confucian Academy,  comprised of five rooms, was built by Jeollanam-do's Confucian scholars in 1983. In addition, Gojiksa Shrine comprised of four rooms in 1972, Jangpangak Pavilion comprised of three rooms and Oesammun Gate in 1978, Sau in 1980 and Naesammun Gate in 1981 were established in order.

Plum blossoms, the symbol of the imperial family of Joseon, are delicately carved along this European-style building. It is considered a remarkable cultural property not only because of its architectural design, unique shape or historic value, but also because it has been surprisingly well-maintained, especially in comparison to other lighthouses built during the same period. In recognition of its unmatched style and preservation, the old Gadeokdo lighthouse was designated Tangible Cultural Property No. 50 of Busan in Sep. 2003. It is owned and managed by the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries. A new lighthouse was built next to the original one in 2002. The new lighthouse structure is octagonal in shape and 40.5m high, the second highest lighthouse in Korea. <br><br>\n\nGadeokdo Island, the location of Gadeokdo lighthouse, is often referred to as the ‘Island of History,’ and is the largest island in Busan.

Today, it is a critical entry point to the Jinhae Bay. <br><br>\n\nGadeokdo Lighthouse is located within a national naval base.
